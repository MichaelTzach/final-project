"1","San Francisco’s Fairmont is a slice of American history.
With an elegant façade and world flags adorning the entryway, the iconic hotel looks like somewhere that would host great dignitaries. And, in fact, it did! History buffs will appreciate that the Fairmont did host the International Conference that led to the birth of the United Nations.
Music fans might like to stay at Fairmont to see the Venetian Room where Tony Bennett first sang, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.” And cocktail fans will love it for the Tonga Room. The tiki bar, serving Mai-Tais and other south Pacific favorites, opened in the 1940s after the end of WWII. The dance floor was originally the deck of the S.S. Forrester, “one of the last of the tall ships that plied the route between San Francisco and the South Sea Islands,” according to Fairmont’s site.
“… we did have drinks in the Tonga room, and highly recommend going to try at least one Maitai. I am normally a G&T girl, but the Maitais were fabulous.” – TripAdvisor traveler dighead
“First of all, even if you do not stay here, GO TO THE TONGA ROOM! It is like a slice of Hawaii in the basement of a fancy hotel!”– TripAdvisor traveler kcormier401
But, of course, a great hotel isn’t just about the nightlife –  it’s about turning in for the night. The Fairmont offers almost 600 guest rooms and 62 suites, including the Signature Golden Gate suite with panoramic views of – you guessed it – the Golden Gate Bridge as well as Alcatraz, Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid.
If you’ve seen the movie “Hangover 2,” you’ve seen Sky Bar, the rooftop cocktail bar on the 52nd floor of Bangkok’s Lebua at State Tower. You can even order a Hangovertini created for the cast of the movie. Located 820 feet above the city, it’s one of the world’s highest rooftop bars.
“The hotel’s countless facilities and restaurants, especially the Sky Bar, made our trip even more memorable. I visited the Sky Bar on our final night and let me tell you, it is a MUST if you wanna feel the essence of Bangkok; its view and the company of my family made that night truly special.” –TripAdvisor traveler Vala s
But Sky Bar isn’t the only thing that makes this hotel worth visiting. Thailand’s premier luxury hotel consistently earns accolades, including TripAdvisor’s 2016 Certificate of Excellence.
The Historic Hay-Adams in Washington, DC was originally built as a residential hotel in the 1920s. It has hosted members of the highest society including Amelia Earhart, Sinclair Lewis and Charles Lindbergh. Located just steps from some of the capitol’s most famous monuments, the stately hotel has now become a landmark itself.
The Hay-Adams also happens to be home to one of DC’s premier cocktail bars, Off The Record. The downstairs bar has a sophisticated, speakeasy vibe and caters to clientele with a sophisticated sense of humor – the coasters are political cartoons.
“One of the most elegant hotels I’ve stayed in. The staff was unanimously helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The room was lovely. Lafayette, for breakfast, fabulous. Off The Record… great people watching.” – TripAdvisor traveler steve L
“The bar downstairs (Off The Record) is infamous…and is in a wonderful location and it is incredibly popular with locals.” – TripAdvisor traveler jindybug
The hotel rooms and suites are decorated in the same classic, elegant style that you see throughout the hotel. One of the most luxurious rooms, the Presidential Suite, will definitely make you feel like American royalty. In fact, the master bedroom (yes, the suite has multiple bedrooms) overlooks the White House.
Do New Orleans in style at Hotel Monteleone. The luxury hotel opened in the French Quarter in 1886, and is just steps away from Jackson Square, Bourbon Street, the French Market and the Riverwalk.
As iconic as the hotel itself is, the bar’s reputation may be even greater. The city’s only revolving bar allows guests to take a spin on the 25-seat Merry-Go-Round.
“The Carousel Bar at Hotel Monteleone is still one of the iconic spots to share a cocktail in the Crescent City, with its’ revolving bar and attractive patrons.” – TripAdvisor traveler SCE53
“This hotel features a carousel bar. The bar looks like a carousel and the stools rotate. This bar is absolutely cool. Also, the common area is wonderful at this hotel.” – TripAdvisor traveler liketoeatcincinnati
Be sure and try the bar’s signature cocktail created in 1938, the Vieux Carre. One of its ingredients is Peychaud’s Bitters, which was invented in New Orleans.
Fans of cocktails, jazz and Bill Murray will love the New York Bar at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo. It’s the place where Murray and Scarlett Johansson’s characters meet in the movie “Lost in Translation.”
The bar, located on the 52nd floor of the hotel, offers stunning views of Tokyo and a chic Manhattan vibe.
“The New York bar is amazing, well worth the cover charge of 2000 yen as the jazz band is quality. Drinks are top quality too. Great views… Bill Murray wasn’t there though.” – TripAdvisor traveler Brendan r
“The New York bar on the 52 floor offers amazing views, great jazz, great cocktails and is one of the best bars I have ever visited anywhere in the world.” – TripAdvisor traveler jmreiff
The hotel is also known for its luxury in-house spa. So if you don’t feel like unwinding with a cocktail one night, you can always opt for a massage, a dip in one of the spa’s pools or a workout class overlooking the city.
If you’ve ever dreamed of having a “Pretty Woman” moment, why not go straight to the Beverly Wilshire in Los Angeles where the movie takes place? You can even order the “Pretty Woman” cocktail at the BLVD Lounge.
“We had cocktails in the bar to live out one of my girlfriend’s fantasies. Very classy establishment, great service & cocktails, she had the “pretty woman” I had “the gentleman ” unlike other posh places we’ve been, this place didn’t have the snootyness of others & was good fun.” – TripAdvisor traveler gurnico
Take it a step further with the “Pretty Woman for a Day” experience package, which includes the Presidential Suite where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere’s characters stayed, a personal shopping consultation and a ride in a Rolls Royce.
Of course, the iconic Beverly Wilshire isn’t just for fans of the movie. The Four Seasons hotel is located in the heart of the city. It also features food by Wolfgang Puck and the hotel’s restaurant, CUT.
The NoMad Hotel is a chic, boutique hotel located in 28th Street in Manhattan. The décor inside, with dark wood and lush seating, makes you feel like you were invited into an elite club. And, in fact, the Library Bar is exclusive to guests.
Bibliophiles will love Library Bar for obvious reasons. It’s a two-level library connected by a spiral staircase. What’s not to love?
“The library bar is on another level and can sometimes be hard to get a seat at. I would recommend calling down in advance so that its ready when you get there. The cocktails here are probably the best I’ve ever had.” – TripAdvisor traveler Sam B
“I wanted to be in close vicinity to the Library Bar and the in-room claw foot bathtub really piqued my interest. The rooms are so chic! Perfect juxtaposition of classic with modern art and light fixtures.” – TripAdvisor traveler hutchcraftduris
The NoMad, located in the Johnston Building – which features an elegant limestone façade built in 1903–is also home to The NoMad Bar, The Elephant Bar, The Parlour and The Atrium, so you can really have a whole night out without leaving the hotel.
The Elephant Bar, which is open to non-guests, is also a good option for a great cocktail. It gets its name from two wooden elephants standing atop the stately and ornate mahogany bar.
“We had a cocktail in The Elephant Bar, which was made by an expert mixologist. The restaurants and bars in this hotel are hopping!!” – TripAdvisor traveler Nanette714
The trendy Drake Hotel in downtown Toronto isn’t just a place to sleep. With art exhibits on hand, the hotel considers itself a “creative incubator, connecting the public with artists working in all media from across town and around the world.”
The night life at The Drake is also perfect for a trendy crowd.
“I took in the Sky Yard (Drake’s on-site bar/restaurant) both nights I was there. They serve up a classy selection of cocktails and a well-crafted menu of food.” – TripAdvisor traveler kahht
“This particular visit we finally made it up to the Sky Yard which is just cool. You know how some places try to be cool – well the Sky Yard doesn’t need to try. They have blankets, and a bon fire, and warm boozy cider, and log piles to sit on.” – TripAdvisor traveler edemec
The art at the Drake flows into the rooms and suites too. Each room is decorated with a mid-century modern aesthetic and showcases cool pieces of modern art.
One of the great things about the Drake is it’s not all about opulence and excess–if all you need is a double bed in a nice, clean room, The Nook room is all you need.
Red Sox fans will want to stay at Boston’s Hotel Commonwealth, located right near Fenway Park and historic Kenmore Square. Of course, no trip to Boston is complete without seafood, and TripAdvisor reviewers rave about the food (especially the oysters) at the hotel’s two restaurants, Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster Bar.
And no trip is complete without a great drink. That’s where the Hawthorne Club, with an expansive list of craft cocktails, comes in.
“The rooms were spacious, the location is outstanding to explore Boston. And Eastern Standard & Hawthorne are outstanding spots for food & drink. Would highly recommend staying at The Commonwealth.” – TripAdvisor traveler JayR122 
“Had a great time in the Hawthorne Club; the drinks were excellent and varied. The staff was attentive and efficient; lots of fun people in attendance.” – TripAdvisor traveler clp2017
True Red Sox fans will want to check out the new Fenway Park Suite. It’s located just 507 feet away from Fenway Park and offers uninterrupted views from the balcony. Inside, you can sleep amongst the #6 from the Green Monster scoreboard, a coffee table signed by Red Sox legends and other cool memorabilia."
"2","Napa Valley is synonymous with wine country in the United States. With hundreds of wineries and vineyards in the region, it’s hard to pick just one to visit.
St. Helena, CA
Along with being famous for wine, Napa is also famous for its steep prices. Wine Country Inn & Cottages is a surprisingly economical option – and you won’t forego any beauty or charm. Lodging options include five luxury cottages, suites, or one of 20 guest rooms and plenty of decks to enjoy the vineyard views.
“A perfect stay in the Napa region – a private cottage with a private patio with vineyard views. A gas fireplace created a cozy setting in the living area. A sprawling bathroom housed a jacuzzi tub and a steam shower. The addition of a reading nook and refrigerator were icing on the cake. The complimentary breakfast included a delicious quiche and plenty of fresh fruit and cheese.” – TripAdvisor traveler joeydomer
Yountsville, CA
For an upscale resort experience, check out Hotel Yountville. Aside from countless wine tastings (and a car service that will bring you to other wineries and restaurants), the hotel also offers luxury spa services and will arrange hot air balloon excursions.
“Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Hotel, grounds and lobby are very attractive. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were large, comfortable and tastefully decorated. Poolside area was beautiful and had large loungers, which were great for relaxing with drinks at the end of the day. Gorgeous fire pits by the pool were lit at night were absolutely stunning. Hotel is in a great location with many restaurants just up the street. Hotel staff happily drove us to dinner each night and there is also a free trolley that runs up and down the street making it very convenient for everything.” – TripAdvisor traveler sandygann
Europe takes the vineyard game to a whole new level. With centuries-old chateaus and castles, and a reputation for exceptional food and wine, France is a no-brainer for those who want a magical vineyard vacation.
Crillon-le-Brave, France
This 2017 TripAdvisor Traveler’s Choice is a manor in the region of Provence called Hotel Crillon le Brave. The stone structure stands tall in among rolling hills, vast fields and – of course – vineyards. The hotel offers a spa, pool and arrangements for local activities.
“This hotel is the epitome of 5* luxury. With its stunning panoramic views over the lavender fields, cherry trees, vineyards and olive groves of the nearby countryside and of course the view of Mont Ventoux, the setting of this hotel is perfect.” – TripAdvisor traveler pinkinik
“Everything was beautifully appointed and the whole property smelled amazing. The spa was amazing. The food at every restaurant was outstanding and, of course, the wine was even better! The room was huge and they had fresh flowers, sparkling wine, and a welcome gift waiting on our arrival.” – TripAdvisor traveler KristinCulb
Meursault, France
Chateau de Citeaux La Cueillette is a stately manor with a mix of old-world and modern décor throughout. Guests can enjoy a spa and gourmet food in a decadently decorated dining room.
“The room was finished to a very high standard. We were extremely well looked after by the receptionist and also by the restaurant staff. The food was superb, not cheap but excellent quality in wonderful surroundings.” – TripAdvisor traveler Richard
You can’t talk about wine without mentioning Italy. The region of Tuscany is famous for its beautiful landscape and great wineries. There are hundreds of vineyards to choose from; here are a couple to consider.
Greve in Chianti, Italy
Villa Bordoni, a boutique hotel in Chianti overlooks stunning, picturesque vineyards – rows upon rows of vineyards. The villa is the former country home of the Bordoni family from Florence. Its origins date all the way back to 11th century, but it was in the 18th century that the vineyards began producing Chianti wine.
“There are not enough words to accurately describe just how perfect our stay at Villa Bordoni was–pure magic! From the incredible and family-like staff, to the breathtaking views, impeccable grounds and dreamy pool it truly is perfection in every way. We were given incredible hiking trails, set up with a private wine tour of one of the most incredible places we’ve ever seen (and we have done quite a few vineyard trips), a top notch cooking class with endless amounts of wine to boot!” – TripAdvisor traveler Jessie h
“This gorgeous property is steeped in history and the owners have maintained a rustic, luxurious feel. The grounds are stunning, as are the surrounding vineyards. The staff was phenomenal and accommodating.”– TripAdvisor traveler gabrielle s
Spaltenna, Italy
Staying at Castello di Spaltenna is like stepping back in time. The main hotel – a castle – overlooks the Tuscan landscape. Nearby, in the medieval village of Borgo di Vertine, are two apartments owned by the hotel for guests who want a more independent experience. The hotel is located near many vineyards where you can enjoy tours of the picturesque landscapes and, of course, sample some of the Chianti region’s famous wines. The hotel’s wine shop sells six exclusive wine labels made from the area’s finest grapes.
“It’s tucked into a hillside with vineyards all around the property. It’s a beautiful property. Our suite was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast was amazing.” –TripAdvisor traveler bob t
“The surrounding countryside is magnificent, with vineyards and olive orchards. There is abundant biking and hiking, which the resort can help you with, It is hilly, so be prepared for a workout.” – TripAdvisor traveler steven g
Spain’s wine region is scattered throughout the country, so you’ll find your spot whether you’re looking for a coastal Mediterranean experience vacation or something on the countryside.
Sardon de Duero, Spain
Hotel Abadia Retuerta Le Domaine is located north of Madrid in a lush green sea of vineyards. The medieval hotel has a Michelin-rated restaurant and a spa.
“After recently staying at LeDomaine, I now have a revised concept of what luxury is. Wish I could give this hotel six stars. Luxury here is in the experience: History, architectural beauty, attention to detail, spaciousness, tranquility, vineyard views, spa perfection, and Michelin-star cuisine. The hotel’s historical setting (12th century abbey, immaculately restored) and sophisticated, modern touches blend seamlessly.” – TripAdvisor traveler pw1986
“Exceptional doesn’t begin to describe this extraordinary refuge, set in the midst of vineyards. Architecturally stunning, this restored abbey is undoubtedly Spain’s finest luxury hotel, blending a storied past with a sophisticated present. Close your eyes and you can almost hear the monks chanting, it’s that magical.” – TripAdvisor traveler pgworld
Unless you’re a big Riesling connoisseur, Germany probably isn’t the first place you would think in Europe to go on a wine tour. But the countryside is home to some of the most magical vineyards around.
Oberwesel, Germany
TripAdvisor reviewers can’t rave enough about the fairytale castle that is Castle Hotel Auf Schoenburg. Located in the Middle Rhine Valley, the castle towers over lush gardens (including a “secret garden”), the river and vineyards. The interior, decorated in traditional German aesthetic, is like walking into a Brother Grimm fairytale.
“This was truly one of the most magical places I have ever been. The rooms are stunning! Hovering over the small town of Oberwesel, this castle commands a spectacular view of the vineyard-covered Rhine River Valley. …Waking up to a foggy morning set us even further in to a fairy-tale as we set out to find the castle’s secret garden; which was absolutely magical, and a photographer’s dream!” – TripAdvisor traveler TS B
“I recommend the wine tour also as we had a memorable experience visiting the tour guides vineyard and wine tasting. We had wines posted back home and was delivered when we arrived home.” – TripAdvisor traveler aussietripper73
With a country as large as Australia, it’s no surprise that its wine country is expansive – with more than 60 designated wine regions. Head to the west if you want sauvignon blanc or head to the Melbourne area for pinot noir, chardonnay and sparkling wine. But Australia’s most iconic wine is the shiraz produced in South Australia. The world’s oldest shiraz vineyards are found in in South Australia’s Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.
Macclesfield, Australia
Juxtaposed with the ancient vineyard hotels of Europe, Longview Vineyard is a completely modern oasis in South Australia. The hotel is a modular metal structure with porches overlooking the vast landscape. The winery’s bottles mimic the artistic aesthetic of the hotel. For example, the bottles of The Piece, Longview’s Shiraz, are adorned with graffiti.
“From the moment we arrived at Longview Vineyard we were impressed. The location is stunning and the layout of the property is great. We enjoyed beautiful food and wine by the open fire. The accommodation was very comfortable and the breakfast provisions were perfect. We can’t wait to go back there!” – TripAdvisor traveler libbyjharris
“Modern facilities and great architectural designed suites. Very well priced. Great views of the vineyard. Also friendly staff and lovely winery. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone visiting the wine regions of South Australia.” – TripAdvisor traveler Rosita s"
"3","As travelers, we’re all citizens of the same world – and while we’re on our own journeys, we can also make a difference for others. That’s the inspiration behind the Wear Your World bracelet created by Lokai and TripAdvisor. Each purchase benefits the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an organization providing urgently-needed support to refugee families and individuals across the globe.
To bring this mission to life, we partnered with Lokai Circle Member and insanely popular Instagrammer Jackson Groves (@jackson.groves) on a Balance Trip to Greece. During his trip, Jackson visited Kara Tepe on the island of Lesbos to see the IRC’s work firsthand, then used TripAdvisor to explore ancient sites and fascinating islands. Here’s his recap of the journey.
By Jackson Groves
According to the Greek Government, 62,000+ refugees fleeing violence are stranded in Greece. Over seven hundred of them are living at Kara Tepe, a site constructed to host refugees arriving on the island of Lesbos. Kara Tepe shelters the most vulnerable refugees, including women traveling alone with children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
I arrived at Kara Tepe not knowing what to expect. A refugee camp? A tent city? As I entered through the entrance gates I was surprised to walk along a paved road, past container style homes. Several women sat outside their homes talking in a close circle, drinking tea.
The infrastructure at Kara Tepe is phenomenal and has been hailed as a leading example for other sites housing refugees around the world. It is a less than ideal situation for any family or individual to be stuck in limbo, wanting to move on with their life, and volunteers at Kara Tepe do their best to make sure this time in limbo, which can often be over a year, is as positive as possible.

Residents at Kara Tepe live in a small container style home. A family of five will share one room with bunk beds. Most of the homes are powered by solar energy. Common toilets, showers, and drinking water are provided in several common areas around the village. As I wandered through the facilities they seemed modern and clean.
Sanitary and cleaning supplies are donated and distributed by a team of volunteers. From a small room in the middle of the village, residents can come and request items such as shampoo, soap, or a hairbrush. In winter, the IRC made sure people had blankets and warm clothes.

Having been shown how the fundamentals work, my interest was piqued by a few anecdotes I was told. For example, a number of residents of Kara Tepe volunteer throughout the village. From teaching English to helping with food distribution, the spirit of the refugees in the village was clear across the board.
I spoke to a number of families and individuals about their experience in Kara Tepe. They didn’t want to be there. That was the general consensus. They wanted to live somewhere free, peaceful, and have a fresh start. However, most people who I spoke to made clear that despite their desire to leave as soon as possible, the conditions at Kara Tepe are safe, respectful, and met their basic needs.
When I first found out I had the opportunity to visit Kara Tepe, I was unsure about the conditions. When I left Kara Tepe, I was honored to have met people with unwavering courage and determination. I was immensely inspired by all of the hard work, selflessness, respect, and drive from the workforce and volunteers.
Ask someone at Kara Tepe, though, and they won’t tell you about their success last week—they will only tell you about their new project or initiative, which they hope will bring improvements to the lives of people who have come so far in search of peace.
For the next part of my trip, I stayed at the Pallas Athena Grecotel Boutique, which I booked on TripAdvisor.  I stayed in one of the “graffiti rooms,” and as I opened my door a sea of red walls enveloped me before I noticed the details. Trees and woodlands covered the walls in a forest wonderland. A small balcony looked out over the neighboring buildings and streets, a perfect spot for me to people watch. Despite the graffiti style of the room, the amenities and bed were still luxurious.
I had also used TripAdvisor to book a day tour to Delphi from Athens. It took just over two hours to get to Delphi, and along the way we enjoyed a guided tour through the bus windows thanks to our knowledgeable guide
The Temple of Apollo at ancient Delphi is arguably the most important historical site in Greece. It dates back to as early as 548 B.C. and was home to the Oracle, a High Priestess known as Pythia who prophesized the will of the god to the people.

The most interesting part of the learning experience for me was hearing from our guide. She told us that prophets would collect information for hours from the individual about their homeland, job, current situation in their region, and so on. Then they would collate all of this data and ultimately they created a large database, which enabled them to make informed decisions.
After exploring the Temple of Apollo for several hours we wandered into the museum. Here the finer details of the temples have been preserved. The intricate ornaments that once adorned the temples can be seen on the walls of the museum. I struggled to wrap my head around the good condition of some of the relics, which are thousands of years old.

Our final stop was a short drive to Tholos of Delphi, a structure that has perplexed historians for years due to its circular shape. I remember looking up at this temple in disbelief. How was this constructed thousands of years ago in such great detail? It made me feel like a speck on an incredibly long timeline of our existence.
Delphi is a historian’s paradise and a mind-blowing experience. Unlike a standard museum, you are able to walk the same paths people used thousands of years ago. That is special and a feeling I will never forget.

For the next day, I’d booked a day cruise on TripAdvisor to the islands of Hydra, Poros, and Aegina, each unique in their own way, which I was about to discover.

After stepping off the boat in Hydra, my senses were overwhelmed. The car-less island uses donkeys to transport people and goods throughout the town. Dogs lay sleeping in doorways, and cats prowl throughout the winding alleys leading up the hills.
It was lucky I wasn’t heading in any particular direction because it truly was a maze. The white buildings and orange roofs paint a beautiful sight from the scenic points atop the hill. After a long climb in the sun I finally made it to a small clearing, which overlooked a church on one side and the entire town and port on the other.

Hydra was my favorite of the three islands. Running through the maze of alleys, streets and stairs led to new discoveries around each corner. I think the absence of cars added to the historic atmosphere in the town, which from the very first moment felt peaceful and slow-paced.
After a brisk jog down the hill to make it back before the ship left we were on our way to the second destination of the day, Poros. My favorite part about Poros was cruising to the port while on the ship, admiring the town from the water. I’ve never experienced towns quite like those in Greece that seem to scale the entire hillside. It is probably not quite extraordinary for many Europeans, but having grown up in flat urban areas the tiered layout of the towns was something to marvel at.
We had 45 minutes to explore the island so I set off into the maze of alleys once again. My favorite little scene from the adventure was a small blue car parked in the middle of nowhere, with no one around. It was a world away from the hustle of a big city.

Arriving at Aegina, we had the option to buy a bus tour of the island scenery or a tour to the Temple of Aphaia and the monastery. I decided to head to the Temple of Aphaia, which was the inspiration for the Parthenon. I’ve never stood in front of a structure in so much awe. The temple was built in 500 B.C. It is truly remarkable and makes you feel like a tiny dot on an incredibly long timeline.

This was an amazing way to get a small taste of some of the Greek islands. In one day we covered so much ground with ample time to relax on the boat in between stops. I could have spent a week on Hydra and maybe someday I will return.

"4","When celebrity chef Charlie Palmer bought this property a few years ago, he was wise not to change a thing about the architecture: The timber-framed Tudor buildings tucked into the redwoods just off Highway 128 recall a childhood fairy tale, with whimsical brickwork spiraling up columns and arching over the gate to one of the two pools. Palmer did add a restaurant, naturally, an intimate place serving light salads and hearty mains sourced from the on-site gardens and nearby farms. The famous truffle chicken takes an hour to prepare, so come early to place your order and sip a cocktail at the bar; they are among the most creative in the valley, with a seasonally shifting menu that includes ingredients like mole bitters and grilled pineapple relish. Book one of the rooms that has an original brick fireplace—each of them wonderfully unique—and ideally a vineyard view and a private hot tub on your patio; the complimentary bottle of Whitehall Lane wine in your room comes from those very rows. There are half a dozen wineries within walking distance, and the house car will take you to St. Helena or Yountville for dinner.
With two 18-hole golf courses (one being the site of an annual PGA tourney), 13 tennis courts, three bocce courts, ten swimming pools, a full-sized fitness center, and the largest spa in the Napa Valley, the Silverado Resort has enough to keep you occupied for an entire weekend without leaving the 1,200-acre property. If the plink of golf balls and the squeak of tennis shoes are music to your ears, this is the place for you. While the architecture can be a bit dated (though in the case of the late-19th-century mansion that houses the lobby and bar, that’s a good thing), the guest rooms have been recently renovated with a clean, modern design. Of the resort’s four neighborhoods, the Mansion Estates are most centrally located; ask for a room in the 400s so that you don’t have to walk through the large parking lot to get to the bar or restaurant. Meals at the Grill are several notches above typical country club fare; the chef, who worked his way up from dishwasher at various venues around the valley, is equally adept at hearty meat dishes and lighter veggie-focused fare. The Market and Bakery sells a variety of gourmet picnic goodies, plus breads and pastries from local standouts Bouchon Bakery and Model Bakery. Many of the spa treatments employ ingredients such as Napa Valley grape seed husks and Meyer lemons from the gardens, with multi-jetted stand-up and Vichy showers to rinse you off after a scrub or wrap.
Want to bring your pooch to wine country? Then the Napa River Inn is the place to stay. Four-footed friends are welcomed by name at the dog bowl outside the lobby, and each receives a blanket, placemat, and food and water bowls. They also have dog biscuits made from Napa Valley wines, and pet sitters who can stay with Fido while you go wine tasting. It’s an admirable program, but it also means that the garbage bins can be a bit odorous, and barking neighbors might wake you up before your complimentary breakfast-in-bed arrives. The spa, in an ivy-covered former police station, uses all organic, wild-harvested, and hand-milled products, applied by an experienced staff who are especially attentive to their clients’ preferences. The hotel is on the National Registry of Historic Places, several of its buildings dating back to Napa’s late-19th-century heyday, their bricks fashioned out of the Napa River’s clay. In the years since, downtown Napa struggled, but the last decade has brought success for an ambitious revitalization plan that started with the Napa River Inn’s opening. The hotel is now a stroll away from dozens of restaurants, shops, and tasting rooms—and if you don’t want to walk home, they’ll send the house Lexus to come pick you up. The newest dining spot in town is The Restaurant at CIA Copia, where you order not from a menu but from carts that the chefs push around the dining room, laden with every dish coming out of the kitchen that evening, plus a cart stocked with ingredients for craft cocktails made tableside and wines you can order by the glass. (Lest you think international spies will be preparing your meal: In these parts, CIA is shorthand for the Culinary Institute of America, a college that recently purchased the Copia food-and-wine complex to complement its Greystone campus further north in Napa Valley.)
To step into the White House Inn is to envy the leather baron who built it as his private, 12,000-square-foot mansion in 1886, combining multiple Victorian styles in the building’s unique, three-sided façade with a leaded-glass front door. (The pool, surrounded by chic cabanas and fire pits, is a more recent addition to the property.) The inn’s décor is contemporary but not overly trendy, with deep navy-blue hallways accented by bright white wainscoting and emerald-green furniture; the 17 guest rooms are decorated in the same palette. Several bottles of wine show up in the lounge each evening, and guests are free to pour whatever they like and relax on the iridescent couches while house music plays in the background. The same marble countertop becomes a gourmet buffet of sweet and savory small-plates breakfast items every morning—a portion of thick-cut bacon served with a fig and a tiny biscuit, quinoa with pomegranate seeds, oatmeal with strawberries and pecans, miniature glass canisters filled with pink grapefruit. The inn is set back from a quiet street in a residential neighborhood just a few blocks south of downtown Napa. It’s a 15-minute walk from Torc, where you’d do well to make reservations for dinner: The boisterous restaurant’s husband-and-wife owners met as line cooks at the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco; now he runs Torc’s kitchen, plating easily shareable dishes that highlight his beloved foraged mushrooms and truffles, house-made pastas, and light-as-clouds sauces, while she heads up an impressive beverage program (it’s one of the few places around where you can order rare wines by the glass). Cap off the night by sliding between some of the softest sheets you’ll ever feel back at the White House Inn, and you’ll be restored and invigorated the next morning for another day of wine tasting in the valley.
If you’re coming to Napa for a girlfriends’ or couples’ getaway, take over the five rooms at the Napa Vineyard House and you’ll have the entire property to yourself, including the red-barn “lounge” stocked with lawn and board games, and the fireside gathering area in the backyard. The catalog-ready rooms are sizeable, each with a fireplace, kitchenette, complimentary mini bar, and views of the surrounding vineyards. The newest section of the Napa Valley Vine Trail runs right past the property (as does Highway 29, though you won’t be bothered by noise in the rooms), so you can borrow a bike and pedal the three miles to Yountville for some day-drinking at the town’s many tasting rooms. In the evening, the house car will bring you back there for dinner; The French Laundry is a Michelin-starred favorite for special occasions, but Redd and Bottega Napa Valley are also standouts, fit for a delicious but more casual meal. A boxed breakfast from Bouchon Bakery is left at your door in the morning; don’t be surprised to catch a hot-air balloon drifting overhead when you retrieve your pastries and orange juice.
Of the towns spread across the Napa Valley, Calistoga feels the most down-to-earth—and the Bergson, which is a short walk from Calistoga’s main drag, is one of the area’s most affordable boutique hotels, with rates starting at less than $125 a night. The rooms are on the small side but elegantly decorated, with baroque touches such as swoop-backed armchairs, gilded mirrors, and marble statuettes. Calistoga was developed as a hot-springs resort in the mid-19th century—its name is a combination of California and Saratoga, a popular east-coast spa town of that era—and today you can indulge in various thermal pools and mud treatments around town. Come evening, head down the road for dinner at All Seasons, an unassuming place frequented by locals as much as out-of-towners, where the superb wine list comes in a humble three-ring binder. A merlot-red ceiling with stained-glass insets and a black-and-white checkerboard floor give the place a French bistro feel, but the menu is all “California cuisine,” borrowing flavors from around the world to develop elements like sesame-soy aioli and saffron-scented risotto.

"5","Although hippies, mood rings, and long-haired rock ‘n’ rollers aren’t as easy to spot these days in the City by the Bay, the spirit of 1967 can still be found. Perhaps no one has kept that spirit more alive than San Francisco local Allan Graves, founder and CEO of San Francisco Love Tours.
We grabbed some time with him to learn how he got his start building one of the most unique tour companies for travelers to San Francisco, a company that celebrates a truly iconic moment in San Francisco history.
TripAdvisor: Take us back to the very beginning. Before you had the idea to start a tour company featuring a VW bus, we heard that you bought your first one “on a whim.” But can you explain that “whim” a bit more for us?
Allan Graves: I’ve always had a thing for Volkswagens. When I first moved to San Francisco from Costa Rica, I was 12 years old and my uncle had an old yellow VW bus. He would take me out exploring in it, so I really got to know the city in a VW.
In the beginning of summer 2014, I was feeling very nostalgic and was looking for a summer vehicle that was cool enough to take to Dolores Park with my family and friends. I was up super late on the internet waiting to start a conference call with my then corporate job’s London office, and I came across an old yellow VW bus for sale.
Immediately, I thought to myself, what if I were to buy a bus, take all my family and friends around the city in it, and go from place to place, making new friends along the way? I’d even joke and say to strangers, “Hop on, hitch a ride with us.” I believed I could take visitors around the city to give them a true local’s perspective and show them all the places I love in San Francisco.
The very next day, my brother and I drove a few hours south to Los Banos, CA and bought the bus.
TA: How did your family react when you drove the VW home for the first time?
AG: It was May 27, 2014. I remember the day exactly because it also happens to be my older brother’s birthday. My family was out to lunch on Union Street celebrating. I had them come outside, and I rolled up honking the horn. Everyone loved it. The bus at the time was yellow, so it reminded everyone of my uncle’s old VW Bug. Immediately my brother and mom hopped in and we took it for a spin around the city.
TA: At what point did you decide that you wanted to move from driving friends and family around San Francisco for fun to building your own full-fledged Love Bus tour?
AG: The very first day I got it, we drove down Union Street and through the Marina and North Beach singing old ‘60s tunes, and everyone smiled at us and flashed us peace signs. The good vibes were contagious. At that moment, I knew this bus was special and that with the right people, narrative, and destinations, the Love Bus would be a hit — something authentic and iconic that belonged in SF.
TA: Who paints the outside of your buses?
AG: From the onset, I knew I wanted to have murals on my bus. I looked around, talked to people, but nothing felt right. Then about two weeks after I bought the bus, I was at Dolores Park detailing the inside when this hippie girl named Madison Tomsic appeared out of nowhere. She told me she owned a VW just like mine and that she’d painted it herself. I checked out her work, fell in love with her art, and asked her if she would paint my bus for me. She painted Love Bus and then every other tour bus of mine thereafter.
TA: The inside of your buses are decked out with shag carpeting, beaded curtains, and more. Was it difficult to find those 1960s icons?
AG: Yes, I have installed every 1960s detail inside of every bus by hand. At first, the biggest challenge was finding the most authentic shag carpets — they have to look and feel just right. There are tons of nylon and synthetic shag carpets out there, so finding the real deal is a challenge.
TA: Pre-Love Bus tour days, do you have a favorite memory of a bystander’s reaction to your bus?
AG: It all happened so quickly. I bought the bus at the end of May and had it painted in June, the weekend before the San Francisco Pride Parade. We drove the bus around during Pride, and I’m not kidding you, hundreds and hundreds of people asked if they could take pictures with the bus. I then started a Kickstarter campaign in August, and by January, my brother and I ran our first tour.
TA: What do you hear most about SF and the Summer of Love (or the 1960s in general) from your Love Bus customers?
AG: Our tour can be very nostalgic for lots of people who were part of the Summer of Love. We’ve really worked on giving the tour a narrative that’s fun, informative, and goes with classic jams from the ‘60s. Lots of people have thanked me for helping them relive an era that was very special to them.
TA: Who has traveled the farthest to take your tour?
AG: We get a lot of friends from New Zealand and Eastern Europe.
TA: Do you ever have locals take the tour?
AG: Yes, we get locals all the time. It’s a great way for locals to show out-of-towners a good time. One of my passengers said that he sold a guitar to Jimi Hendrix during the Summer of Love. Lots of things happen on a Love Tour — we even had a marriage proposal. That was super special.
TA: What’s the difference between giving locals vs. tourists the Love Bus treatment?
AG: Both are so fun. With tourists, San Francisco is such a beautiful city, so it’s rad to show them the iconic, picturesque landmarks they’ve heard about for the first time but in an intimate way. Since our buses are small we get to take them down the streets that big city buses can’t, such as Lombard Street.
When it’s your job to tell people the history of San Francisco, you end up learning so much at the same time. So with locals, it’s amazing to educate people, show them places, and teach them things about their city they never knew. I’ve lived here for over 25 years and didn’t learn any of this stuff until I decided to start a tour company.
TA: What’s the best part of your day-to-day?
AG: Honestly, when I get an email from TripAdvisor and I see a 5-star review get posted.
TA: Where do you find your tour guides? Tell us a little bit about the process of finding the perfect guide.
AG: All over. Some we have gotten from the International Tourism Management Institute, and others are a result of good old-fashioned grassroots recruiting. The most important thing with our drivers is that they be natural storytellers. They have to be charismatic, witty, smart…oh, and they have to be able to drive a stick shift!
TA: What’s your favorite Love Tour stop, and why?
AG: Dolores Park on a Saturday afternoon, packed with people. You can see the city in the background and see that people just feel free. Everyone’s relaxing and having a good time with family and friends.
TA: Why should a traveler take a San Francisco Love Tour?
AG: We love to educate, entertain, and inspire our guests. The San Francisco Love Tour is all about peace, love, freedom, and adventure.” It’s about leaving our guests with a nostalgic, authentic SF experience they can’t get anywhere else.
TA: Where would you like to see San Francisco Love Tours in five years?
AG: When people think of coming to SF, I want them to think of the Golden Gate Bridge, the cable cars, and hitching a ride on one of our buses.
TA: When you have a friend visiting SF for the first time — besides taking your tour, where else do you recommend they visit?
AG: I grew up in the Mission, so first I would say to grab a burrito at Pancho Villa, then head over to The Devil’s Acre in North Beach for a cocktail. Then, if you’re up for a San Francisco classic, check out Beach Blanket Babylon. If you’re in the mood for dressing up, visit The Speakeasy Theater.
TA: What’s your favorite song to play for customers when leading a Love Tour?
AG: My favorite moment on the tour is when we’re leaving the Golden Gate Bridge and I play Janis Joplin’s Me & Bobby McGee. It’s just an epic song with such an iconic SF backdrop.
TA: And YOUR favorite song from the 1960s?
AG: That’s easy. All You Need is Love by the Beatles.
Cheers to that, Allan and thanks so much for taking the time to sit down with us.

"6","See the Muggle World Through Wizard Eyes
As Potter fans know, London is the beating heart of both muggle and magical Britain, most notably at King’s Cross Station. Although Harry had trouble finding Platform 9 ¾ on his first try, you’ll have an easier time—just look for the disappearing luggage cart and snap your obligatory photo. Also downtown, visit the street that inspired Diagon Alley, the building that served as Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and the house that became the Order of the Phoenix headquarters in the films. String these sites together on a Potter-themed bus tour, or treat yourself to a private Harry Potter tour by black cab. If you’re short on time and want to combine magical sites with major London landmarks, book a comprehensive city sightseeing tour by double-decker bus.
Peel Back the Curtain at Warner Bros. Studios
For a deeper dive into all things Potter, make the one-hour pilgrimage from central London to Warner Bros. Studios, home to original sets, props and costumes from the film empire. You might forget you’re a muggle as you wander familiar spots like the Gryffindor common room, discover secrets behind the films’ special effects and even ride a broomstick in front of a green screen. Do it all on a guided studio tour for a real insider experience, or explore on your own—either way, round-trip transport from London is included.
Accio Bed: Where to Stay
Staying at The Georgian House, a.k.a. “The Harry Potter Hotel,” is the closest you’ll get to sleeping in a Hogwarts dormitory. Book early to snag the Potter-themed rooms: either the Wizarding Chambers (big enough for families) or the Enchanted Chambers (perfect for magic-loving couples).
Evanesco Hunger: Where to Find Eats and Drinks
Grab a pint at The Market Porter pub, which was transformed into the Third Hand Book Emporium (right next to the infamous Leaky Cauldron) in the “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban” movie.
Walk the Hallowed Halls of Hogwarts
Although muggles know the University of Oxford for notable alumni, such as Oscar Wilde and Margaret Thatcher, Potterheads flock to campus to see where Harry and friends studied—and, of course, got “up to no good.” Be sure to visit Christ Church College’s Great Hall, the inspiration for the Great Hall of Hogwarts, and check out the Bodleian Library, which served as the wizard prep school’s library (Hermione’s second home) and infirmary in the films. If you’re coming from London for the day, see these sites and more on a combo trip to Warner Bros. Studios and Oxford’s campus. If you’ll already be in Oxford, explore the grounds through Harry’s eyes on a walking tour of key filming locations.
Accio Bed: Where to Stay
For a Hogwart-ian lodging experience, book a room at the Macdonald Randolph Hotel. Located in a historic building just minutes from the Oxford campus, the hotel’s main stairwell is reminiscent of Hogwarts’ Grand Staircase—but don’t worry, this one doesn’t move.
Evanesco Hunger: Where to Find Eats and Drinks
To round out your Harry Potter experience in Oxford, grab a table at the Turf Tavern, where the cast and crew often relaxed between takes. Or pick up picnic provisions at the nearby Oxford Covered Market and eat on the quad, imagining you’re surrounded by your favorite wizards.
Seek Out the Original Wizarding World of Harry Potter™
Universal Studios Orlando made headlines that reached beyond The Daily Prophet when the first Wizarding World of Harry Potter™ opened in 2010 and again when it expanded in 2014. Although Hogsmeade Villages were also built in LA and in Osaka, Japan’s Wizarding World of Harry Potter™,  Orlando offers the only park with a complete Diagon Alley replica. You can conveniently travel between Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley on the Hogwarts Express. Be sure to check out rides unique to Orlando, such as Dragon Challenge™ and Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringott’s™. Book your tickets on TripAdvisor (US and Canada residents here; United Kingdom residents here).
Accio Bed: Where to Stay 
Staying onsite gives you special access to the Potter attractions one hour before the park opens, which means fewer crowds and less heat. If you go that route, try the retro-themed Cabana Bay, an affordable option for families. If you’d prefer to stay off site, The DoubleTree is a convenient option that’s just as close to the park entrance as most onsite hotels, if not closer.
Evanesco Hunger: Where to Find Eats and Drinks
It’s not just about the rides in Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. Cool off midday with Butterbeer™ ice cream at Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour, or dig into British pub food at The Leaky Cauldron or the Three Broomsticks Restaurant.
Check Out the Wizarding World of the West Coast
In 2016, the newest Wizarding World of Harry Potter™ opened at Universal Studios Hollywood. Just 30 minutes from downtown Los Angeles, west coast wizards can now soar over Hogwarts on Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey™ and fly by Hagrid’s hut on the Flight of the Hippogriff™. Plus, the Hollywood Hogsmeade boasts a unique Hogwarts Express—although the train doesn’t move like it does in Orlando, LA’s locomotive has original luggage racks and props from the movies. Book general admission tickets, or beat the crowds with a skip-the-line pass.
Accio Bed: Where to Stay
To save time in transport, stay at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City, just a five-minute walk from the park entrance. If you’d like a mid-century modern feel, consider the nearby Garland, which offers complimentary shuttle service to Universal Studios. No matter which you choose, it’ll be much better than sleeping in a cupboard under the staircase.
Evanesco Hunger: Where to Find Eats and Drinks
When it’s time to refuel, make your way to the Three Broomsticks Restaurant, which serves up muggle classics like fish and chips, plus witch and wizard favorites like Butterbeer™ and pumpkin juice.
Explore Harry Potter of the East 
Osaka is home to Asia’s only Wizarding World of Harry Potter™, open since 2014. The Universal Studios Japan location has all the highlights of Hogsmeade, plus one unique addition: the spooky, bubbling Great Lake (a.k.a. Black Lake), which may be hiding Grindylows and Selkies below the surface. For easy access from Tokyo, book an overnight package with park tickets, round-trip transport on the bullet train and a night in a central Osaka hotel.
Accio Bed: Where to Stay
If you book the round-trip package from Tokyo, your lodging in Osaka is included. If you go it on your own, choose one of the hotels around the corner from the park, such as Kintetsu Universal City or Hotel Keihan Universal Tower.
Evanesco Hunger: Where to Find Eats and Drinks
When in Hogsmeade, snack on Bertie Bott’s Every-Flavour Beans™ from Honeydukes™, or indulge in a Great Feast Platter at the Three Broomsticks Restaurant. If you want to keep the UK theme going when you’re back in central Osaka, head to The Blarney Stone Pub. Otherwise, switch gears and sample some Japanese flavor on a local food tour.
Apparating to Singapore anytime soon? Dine at Platform 1094, where you can don a wizard hat, sip on goblets of fire and top off your meal with a Dark Arts-inspired dessert."
"7","Rock ‘n’ roll may have been born in the US, but no city in the world has played as crucial a role in the genre’s evolution as London. The English capital witnessed the making and breaking of Jimi Hendrix, defined the punk rock aesthetic, and introduced iconic artists and bands such as David Bowie and the Rolling Stones to the world. See the recording studios, gig venues, and hangouts associated with the likes of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd on the London Rock Music Tour or catch a gig at one of Camden Town’s legendary music venues, or recreate the Abbey Road album cover on an evening walking tour through central London.  
Where to stay:
The Portobello Hotel in Notting Hill has hosted the likes of Blur, U2, Mick Jagger, and the Sex Pistols since it opened in 1971. Room 16, or the Exceptional Room, is where the fashion model Kate Moss and the Hollywood actor Johnny Depp are rumored to have bathed in a tub filled with Champagne.
Drinks and more:
100 Club on Oxford Street hosted the first ever punk festival in 1976, with a line-up including the Sex Pistols and the Clash. Today, it’s a great place to see local or undiscovered talent, as well as more established names.
Many great musicians have left their mark on Berlin, but it was Bowie above all others whose music captured the spirit of young Berliners. On the David Bowie and the End of the World Walking Tour, travel back to the mid-to-late 1970s, when the Thin White Duke called the divided city home and was working on his heralded Berlin Trilogy. See where he lived, worked, and partied — including the legendary Hansa Studios and the apartment building he shared with Iggy Pop — and finish up with a drink at one of his old haunts.
Where to stay:
Opened in 2010, the nhow Berlin markets itself as Europe’s first music hotel. Indulge your rockstar fantasies with a tour of one of the hotel’s two recording studios, or order a guitar or keyboard from the room service menu.
Drinks and more:
One of Berlin’s first punk venues, Kreuzberg’s SO36 was a favorite hangout of Bowie and Iggy Pop. Today, it’s still a fixture of the city’s live music scene, staying true to its punk roots while also embracing new artists and more experimental musicians.
Few cities boast a musical heritage as rich as New York City’s. Punk rock, new wave, disco, and hip-hop all have their roots in the Big Apple, as does salsa music, which emerged from the city’s Latino neighborhoods in the 1960s. Watch live jazz in Harlem, sing along during a Brooklyn gospel music tour, or discover up-and-coming talent at Mercury Lounge. For something on the more formal side, see who’s playing at Radio City Music Hall, or get tickets to the latest Broadway blockbuster.
Where to stay:
The Bowery Hotel in the East Village is a stone’s throw from the former site of the legendary CBGB punk club, and only a short walk from the historic Bowery Ballroom concert venue.
Drinks and more:
Cafe Wha? was instrumental in launching the careers of Bob Dylan (he played his first-ever NYC show here), the Velvet Underground, Jimi Hendrix, and Bruce Springsteen — among others. Head there any night of the week to hear live music, drink beer, and immerse yourself in 50 years of rock ‘n’ roll history.
San Francisco was ground zero for the 1967 Summer of Love, with musicians like Janis Joplin, Big Brother, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead all breaking new musical ground at venues such as the Avalon, the Fillmore, and even Golden Gate Park. Fifty years later, their influence can still be felt on the streets of Haight-Ashbury. Hitch a ride on the Magic Bus to see counterculture sites in Haight-Ashbury, Golden Gate Park, and North Beach; turn onto San Francisco’s top attractions on the Love Bus tour; or grab a ticket to the Summer of Love: Art, Fashion, and Rock & Roll exhibition at the de Young Museum.
Where to stay:
The Phoenix Hotel has welcomed everyone from Joan Jett to the Red Hot Chili Peppers through its doors. Have brunch or drinks at the hotel’s restaurant, Chambers, which houses one of the country’s largest record collections.
Drinks and more:
Vesuvio Café has been a hangout for writers, artists, and musicians — including Joplin — since it opened in 1948. Order the Bohemian Coffee (coffee with brandy and amaretto) and indulge in the nostalgia.
Seattle will forever be associated with the grunge movement of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, but long before Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains were giving sell-out performances and plaid flannel shirts once again became a rebellious fashion statement, Seattle had cemented its place in rock ‘n’ roll history as the home of Jimi Hendrix. Snag yourself a Seattle CityPASS and head to the Museum of Pop Culture to see the Nirvana and Jimi Hendrix exhibitions, featuring hand-written lyrics, instruments, memorabilia, and photographs.
Where to stay:
The Edgewater has had the (questionable) honor of having its rooms trashed by the Who, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. Make a reservation for The Beatles Suite, where the Fab Four stayed during their 1964 tour of America.
Drinks and more: 
Catch a gig at The Crocodile, where local bands such as Nirvana and Death Cab for Cutie played before making it big.
From Celine Dion’s 1,000+ shows at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace to All Shook Up at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino, headlining residences and shows draw as many travelers to Las Vegas as gambling and all-night parties. Score meet-and-greet tickets for Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, or Mariah Carey, or watch the Beatles done Cirque du Soleil®–style at the Mirage Hotel. For the quintessential Vegas experience, visit the home of Wayne Newton, aka Mr. Las Vegas, and take a ride down the Strip in a pink Cadillac with Elvis.
Where to stay:
The Hard Rock Hotel is one of the best hotels in Sin City for celeb-spotting, but even if you don’t see any rockstars, you’ll find Prince’s Purple Rain suit, Keith Richards’ guitar, Madonna’s underwear, and other memorabilia displayed throughout the hotel casino.
Drinks and more:
Off the Strip in an unassuming strip mall, you can sit in the booths of Old Blue Eyes and his fellow Rat Pack, among other Sinatra-era celebs, at the Golden Steer Steakhouse.
K-pop stepped onto the world stage in 2012 with the release of Psy’s “Gangnam Style.” However the genre has been a fundamental part of South Korean pop culture for years, even branching out beyond music into K-beauty, K-dance, and K-food. One of the best ways to experience K-pop in Seoul is to get an admission ticket to see a live broadcast of a K-pop show. You can also visit K-Pop Experience: KLive Hologram Experience, an innovative concert venue featuring hologram performances by K-pop stars such as Big Bang and 2NE1.
Where to stay:
Aloft Seoul Myeongdong is located in the neighborhood of Myeongdong, one of Seoul’s main shopping districts.

"8","There’s nothing more quintessentially New England than breathing in the sea air in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Take in historical lighthouses and houses in the picturesque city, step back in time at the open-air Strawbery Banke Museum or take a short drive to Rye where you can walk the seawall and then treat yourself to a lobster roll and an ice cream at The Beach Plum.
This charming Victorian house will take you back in time with traditional wallpaper and antique furniture. And you can’t beat the location – it’s within steps to downtown Portsmouth.
The Hampton Inn gets kudos from travelers for free breakfast AND a shuttle into Portsmouth.
The Oregon coast is known for its natural beauty, so it’s a perfect beach getaway for the nature lover. Cannon Beach is famous for the iconic Haystack Rock that you may remember from The Goonies. The wide sandy beach is the place to go for sun soaking and swimming. It’s located within minutes of Ecola State Park where you can find wilder, more untouched beaches full of ocean life, plants and hiking opportunities.
If you have time for a couple of road trips, in less than two hours you will find yourself in Portland, and in three hours you’ll be at the Columbia River Gorge where you can take in breathtaking river views and hike through the lush Pacific Northwest fauna.
It’s all about the views at the Surfsand Resort. Lounge on the balcony at this beach-front hotel and look over Haystack Rock and far beyond the horizon where the mountains meet the beach.
Staying right on Cannon Beach can cost you, but The Waves offers reasonable prices without sacrificing impressive ocean views. It can get chilly in the Pacific Northwest, so the in-room fireplaces and the hot tub will keep you cozy on the coast.

Travelers say this hotel feels like a “mom and pop business” offering free breakfast and a wine and cheese reception in the evening. It’s also walking distance to casinos, restaurants and a private beach.
For a magical oasis in the mountains, head to Telluride, Colorado.

You guessed it: The Victorian Inn is an old Victorian house-turned hotel right in downtown Telluride. If you take advantage of the continental breakfast, travelers say go for the cinnamon rolls.
Take a trip back to the Victorian era right in the middle of Lake Huron. Mackinac Island is a picturesque getaway with a quaint downtown that you can explore by bike or horseback. Sporty vacationers can go kayaking, fishing or parasailing while those who want to relax can take a boat tour or play a round of golf.
This beautiful antique mansion sits right on the harbor offering unparalleled water views and perfectly manicured grounds. Travelers insist you don’t have to leave the hotel to eat, as the hotel’s restaurant is top notch.
You won’t find too many bargains on the island, but this antique mansion’s prices beat out some, and it’s like something out of The Great Gatsby. You can roam the expansive lawn down to the waterfront or lounge in the rustic stone and wood-beamed lobby. It’s walking distance to town and offers bike rentals.
Backpack, hike and cycle more than 700 miles of hiking trails in the Rocky Mountains at Glacier National Park.

You might feel like you’re on Mars amongst the famous Sedona red rocks and canyons. There are also beautiful forests to explore and a vibrant art community. You can explore the landscape by foot, by ATV or Jeep or by air on a hot air balloon tour, and when you’re done, wind down with a round of gold or visit to one the resort town’s many spas.
This beautiful resort hotel is located amongst the red rocks offering amazing views from the outdoor dining area and rooms. Inside, the rooms are decorated in a Mid-Century Modern style with fun art on the walls. Take a walk down to town or have the hotel shuttle bring you to farther restaurants and attractions.
Take a dip in the pool while gazing up at the gorgeous rock formations in the distance. The Pueblo-style façade of the hotel will give your vacation a true southwestern vibe.
North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains are a sight to behold, and in Asheville you can climb them, hike them or take in the view by car along the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway. There’s also a vibrant community in town with plenty of great shopping, food and craft beer. Take a drive over to Biltmore castle and feel like you’re in a fairy tale. Created by George Vanderbilt in 1895 as a retreat, Biltmore is meant to resemble the castles and estates of France and Britain.
The lobby in this Tudor style mansion looks like something out of Beauty and the Beast with severe, elegant stonework, high ceilings and chandeliers. Sculptures and artwork are displayed around the hotel giving it a unique blend of old and new world.
Stay right near the Biltmore Estate without breaking the bank. The hotel is located about 10 minutes from the Biltmore and 10 minutes from downtown Asheville and the Blue Ridge Parkway. Enjoy a complimentary breakfast before you head out."
"9","Splurge stay: Want to live like royalty? Book a weekend at the Castle Hotel & Spa in Tarrytown, built in 1910 in the style of a Norman castle in medieval Europe. Though just 30 minutes from Manhattan, the rolling hills of the Hudson Valley will have you feeling like you’re deep in the countryside. The spa features couples’ treatments and Thai massages, and the Equus Restaurant serves dishes that rely on the bounty of the surrounding farmland.
Value option: The Storm King Art Center is one of the hidden gems of the Hudson Valley – a world-class sculpture park full of works by Alexander Calder, Mark di Suvero and Andy Goldsworthy – and the Cromwell Manor Historic Inn is just a few minutes down the road in Cornwall. Groups can rent out the four guest rooms in the 1764 House (named for the year in which it was constructed); there are an additional nine rooms in the Manor House, a brick mansion that dates back to 1820. Gourmet breakfasts are included in the rates; stroll next door to Grandma Phoebe’s Kitchen at Jones Farm for a delicious sandwich or salad at lunchtime.
Splurge stay: Spain’s prestigious Ribera del Duero wine region is just a few hours from the country’s capital. For a romantic weekend getaway (particularly if you have something to celebrate), try the Hotel Abadia Retuerta Le Domaine. This 2017 TripAdvisor Travelers’ Choice property is the result of a careful restoration of a Romanesque abbey that dates to 1146 – so peace and tranquility are a given. The 27 rooms and three suites (each of which comes with butler service) look out onto vineyards, and the spa offers a grape seed body polish. The food at Refectorio Restaurant is good enough to earn a Michelin star; make sure to pair it with award-winning wines from the same estate (which you can tour during your stay).
Value option: Wine is the predominant theme at the Hotel El Lagar de Isilla, run by a winemaking family and quirkily decorated throughout with bottles, barrels and other winemaking paraphernalia. And you won’t walk away with an empty wallet: Says TripAdvisor traveler rmarshp, “The hotel has a restaurant and a café/bar. Both serve superb food at reasonable prices and the excellent wine, made on the premises, is equally reasonably priced.”
Splurge stay: If city life has you wound too tight, Carmel Valley Ranch is the ideal antidote: Five hundred acres on the Monterey Peninsula set aside as a playground for every age. There’s an 18-hole golf course, eight tennis courts, three pools, numerous trails to traverse by foot or horseback, an apiary where you can learn about beekeeping, an Adventure Kitchen that hosts garden-to-table cooking demos and a 10,500-square-foot spa. It’s a great place to bring the whole family – and to enjoy some adult time, thanks to the Ranch Hands Kids Camp. Accommodations range from studios to four-bedroom suites, all with private decks and fireplaces.
Value option: When it’s hoodie-and-sweatpants weather on San Francisco’s beaches, pack your bikini and drive south to Santa Cruz’s Dream Inn, a 1960’s-era hotel that has recently been remodeled with all the modern amenities while keeping the retro surfer vibe.  The cheerfully decorated rooms all look out to the beach from floor-to-ceiling windows, and there’s a brand-new pool and an oversized hot tub. Not only is the inn’s beach access the best you’ll find in town, but you’re also a short walk from the Beach Boardwalk (famous for its Coney Island-style amusement park) and you can borrow a cruiser bike to pedal along the gorgeous coastline.
Splurge stay: The Blue Mountains are a favorite getaway for Sydneysiders wanting a dose of nature. If luxury is what you have in mind, look no further than the Emirates One&Only Wolgan Valley, a five-star resort set amidst a 7,000-acre wildlife reserve and a TripAdvisor 2017 Travelers’ Choice property. If you can manage to tear yourself away from your villa’s private pool, there are guided nature walks, historical tours, stargazing activities and plenty more to keep you busy. The all-inclusive rates, while on the steep side, include all meals, soft drinks, house wines and beers with meals and two daily on-site nature activities per person.
Value option: If you want to explore the Blue Mountains on a budget, consider the Black Gold Motel, which earns praise from TripAdvisor travelers for its warm staff and well-appointed standard rooms and three- and four-bedroom cabins. From the motel’s location in Wallerawang – a charming town that feels of another era – it’s a short drive to three national parks: Marrangaroo, Blue Mountains and Wollemi. Hearty meals are served in the Crib Room Restaurant.
Splurge stay: Normandy has much to lure weekend visitors from the city: Charming villages, picturesque cliffs along the coast, the famous landmark of Mont-St-Michel, and history that spans from ancient times to the 20th century – all just a few hours’ drive from Paris. The décor at Chateau d’Audrieu is just what you’d expect from a countryside chateau – lots of gold filigree, elaborately designed wallpapers and armchairs covered in shiny fabrics. What you might not expect to find is a tree house, the most unusual of the accommodations, which looks out onto the English gardens.
Value option: Chateaux aren’t just for those with deep pockets, though: At the four-star Hotel Chateau de Bellefontaine, you can sometimes snag a room in this 18th-century mansion for under $100 a night. A 15-minute walk from the charming medieval town of Bayeux (home of the Bayeux Tapestry, one of the most impressive works of art that we have left from the 11th century), the estate’s grounds feature a moat, a pond with a rowboat and swans, tennis courts and spacious lawns for relaxing.
Splurge stay: An hour-long train ride from Rome brings you to Bracciano, on the shores of the same-named lake. The most luxurious place to stay nearby is the Hotel Villa Clementina, which one traveler called “an oasis of tranquility” and an ideal escape from the city. Beautiful frescoes ­– done by the owner – adorn the seven rooms, and the spa (equipped with a Jacuzzi, Turkish bath, and Finnish sauna) is designed to be reserved for private use. Spend your days on one of the lake’s small beaches (no motorized boats are allowed, so it’s a peaceful place), or explore Bracciano’s winding streets and medieval castle.
Value option: If you need a weekend getaway that your bank account will barely notice, check in at the Hotel Massimino in Anguillara Sabazia, also on Lake Bracciano. This three-star property earns praise for its clean rooms and friendly staff; it’s very close to the train station, but a drive from the town center and the lake (a scheduled shuttle can take you there). In addition to standard rooms and suites, the hotel has several apartments equipped with kitchens – though you’ll see many locals dining at the onsite Restaurant Massimino."
"10","For many, traveling the world is a lifelong goal; Cassie De Pecol can check that off her bucket list at 27 years old. On February 2, 2017 De Pecol became the fastest person and first documented woman to visit every sovereign nation in the world.
Her Guinness World Record-breaking journey brought her to 196 countries and took 18 months and 26 days; the previous record was three years and three months.
Now that the expedition is over, De Pecol is certainly not settling down. She had a short stop in the states before heading to Antarctica on an eleven-day environmental expedition. Before she left, we picked her brain about her journey, travel tips and how she relied on TripAdvisor throughout her expedition.

De Pecol grew up in the small rural town of Washington, Connecticut. She didn’t get out much, but she had the itch.
“I think I had just grown up wanting to see the world, especially coming from a small town, and see what else is out there. Whenever I could leave my own state I would get excited,” she said.
After high school De Pecol attended Long Island University Global College in Costa Rica and Nicaragua where she majored in environmental studies. After that, she attended a number of other colleges and universities but ultimately decided not to finish her degree.
“College didn’t really give me what I needed.” she said. “Then I realized­–flash forward–there’s a Guinness World Record and there’s been no woman on record. That’s how I found my calling.”
De Pecol saved up $10,000 babysitting but needed financial backing for her expedition. She found support in the International Institute of Peace.
“It resonated with me the most and the founder believed in my mission; he trusted in me,” she said.  Her mission was to promote peace through tourism.
Throughout her trip, she visited 40 universities around the world and talked to students about being open to new cultures, new religions and making friends.
“I’ve learned to be more accepting and respectful of people. So many people are so inspirational; I’ve learned to be more open-minded,” she said.
Now that her expedition is over, De Pecol says the world does feel a lot smaller. She has a list of places she wants to return to, and will continue traveling but for now, she’s done with long expeditions.
“I have been playing with the idea of going to territories and colonies, but I don’t know if I want to do everything because then there’s nothing left,” she said. “You’d have to go to the moon.”
“The best piece of advice I got was to get rest wherever you can. You need to sleep because [traveling] is so sporadic. I will pass out whenever I can–trains, planes.”
De Pecol’s top apps to download are TripAdvisor, Google Maps, Google Translate and Uber.

“I like to wander; not go to the museums and the sites. I like to go to the little old lady’s house and the communities. That’s how you get to know the culture.”
“I had never used TripAdvisor before, but I really relied on it on this expedition,” De Pecol said.  “You can really see in the reviews, if the Wi-Fi is good etc. I also used it to see the location of the hotels. Is it convenient? Is it close to the airport? I’ve become a pretty good contributor too.
The reviews that people post are the most useful because the hotel can post great photos but the guest photos really are helpful to show the realness.
When I go in I just type hotels near this city, and rank by most popular to see what’s highly rated from the people who stayed there so you can justify how decent the place is. I filter it out – sometimes I want to be in a unique location or near a monument or university.”

De Pecol talked to students about responsible tourism that supports the local economy and sustainable tourism–finding restaurants that source their produce from local farms and energy efficient lodging. She used TripAdvisor to help her achieve this.
De Pecol wanted to stay at sustainable luxury hotels. “I would research on TripAdvisor for the best hotels, and it would come up with a list. I would choose the most sustainable. Then I would reach out to them.” De Pecol also planted trees throughout her trip and hopes to offset her carbon footprint by 2020.
You hear this all the time, but De Pecol says this simple advice is key when planning a long journey–no heavy backpacks or suitcases. You can pick up anything you need around the world, she says.
“I brought a little makeup bag with mascara, blush and bronzer. I’ve had to let go of taking care of my hair. You can bring some stuff to help like coconut oil,” she said.
Visa requirements are different for every country, so it is important to get the correct information on the embassy site and leave enough time for the application to be processed and approved – for some countries this can be nearly instant, while others can take weeks or months.  De Pecol said acquiring visas for Yemen and Syria was very difficult, so keep that in mind before you book any flights.
If you plan on going on an epic expedition like De Pecol, a piggy bank won’t be enough. Even with all her planning and budgeting, De Pecol found herself out of money at one point and had to go home to Connecticut to regroup. In June, De Pecol plans to begin running seminars to teach people how to find financial backing for trips like hers.

“Before I traveled to any country, I tried not to research too much about the culture. But I do research currency, language and basic respect. In Muslim countries, it’s better to wear a hijab even if you don’t need one. It’s important for women to ensure whether they need to cover up just to be respectful. I traveled the world in my workout tights–they go with any climate–but in some countries I had flowy pants to throw on.”
De Pecol traveled the world as a single woman and said she rarely felt unsafe. But she does advise women to take precautions and be prepared.
Learn to defend yourself
Krav Maga Worldwide was one of De Pecol’s sponsors on the expedition so she took some self-defense classes from them. Though she luckily never had to use it, she recommends women learn some basic self-defense moves before heading out alone.
Skip the nightlife and don’t wander alone after dark
“I know its hard, but don’t go out and party; don’t go out to bars. That’s where you can really be taken advantage of,” she said. “On this trip I did not go out at all. If I wanted a glass of wine, I stayed in my room and drank it.”
“There was one point I was walking at night and I said ‘you know what; just turn around and get a taxi.’”
“Most recently, Pakistan [is my favorite place I visited]. I’m putting them in the spotlight because they get such a bad rep, and I experienced kindness and hospitality. You have the mountains and the beaches, and you get a mix of Asian culture and Middle Eastern culture. That’s what I love about it.”

"11","As travelers, we’re all citizens of the same world – and while we’re on our own journeys, we can also make a difference for others. That’s the inspiration behind the Wear Your World bracelet created by Lokai and TripAdvisor. Each purchase benefits the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an organization providing urgently-needed support to refugee families and individuals across the globe.
To bring this mission to life, we partnered with Lokai Circle Member, blogger and popular Instagrammer Madeleine Schneider-Weiffenbach (@pilotmadeleine) on a Balance Trip to Thailand, home to more than 100,000 refugees from neighboring Myanmar. Madeleine visited a refugee community to see the IRC’s work firsthand, then used TripAdvisor to make some great Thailand travel discoveries. Here are the highlights in her own words.
By Madeleine Schneider-Weiffenbach (@pilotmadeleine)
I have been to Thailand before, but this visit was extra special because I was invited by Lokai and TripAdvisor to spend a day with the International Rescue Committee, the IRC, in Mae Sot. For those who do not know what the IRC is, it is groups of dedicated people who respond to the world’s worst humanitarian crises and help refugees rebuild their lives.
Having spent the day with IRC I really got to understand their work better. I met with Lighthouse, a foundation supported by the IRC, that provides legal assistance to refugees and teaches them about their rights in Thailand. This helps refugees navigate the legal system in Thailand- it is a much-needed service and I was very impressed with the impact of their work!

On our second stop, we visited Dr. Cynthia Maung – who has been recognized by many organizations such as the UN for her amazing work with Burmese refugees and beyond. She runs a free clinic, Mae Tao, along the border that serves 150,000 people a year! We discussed healthcare issues for the displaced along the border, giving great insights into issues refugees face and the incredible service she provides for them.
Visiting the children’s orphanage was my favorite part of the day; we were able to meet the cutest Burmese children; they loved my boyfriend’s tattoos! Although I was happy to see how sweet and happy these children were, I was saddened by the idea of how limited their perspective of Thailand was. Even though they attend Thai schools, it will be difficult for them going to a university or even work in Thailand. I hope that when they grow up, things will be different!

The entire day was one of the most intensely rewarding days of my life. I am truly thankful that I was able to experience this! How often we worry about such little things and don’t appreciate what we have. In those moments I will definitely think back to this day I got to spend at the IRC.
For the next part of our trip, we stayed in Ko Samui, which has become one of my favorite places in Thailand; it is not as touristy as Bangkok or Phuket and has an amazing natural environment!
We were super happy to stay there again for three nights; for our hotel, we booked the W Retreat Koh Samui on TripAdvisor. Our jungle villa offered complete privacy, and the other villas offered more scenic views; so it all depends on what you prefer. The beach at W Koh Samui is beautiful, so don’t forget to miss watching the sunset there because it is stunning! Overall we absolutely loved our stay and it has become one of our favorite hotels in Thailand.

While in Thailand, you definitely need to book some excursions. We did some amazing things while on our trip, and one of our favorites was the full-day trip to Koh Tao and Koh Nang Yuan. We booked our tour on TripAdvisor, which was a good decision because it not only saved time, but also gave us a great experience with the entire tour and company; they were very reliable and professional!
Our day began when we were picked up at the hotel around 8am and around 9am we officially started our trip with a 1 ½ hour boat drive to our first stop, Koh Nang Yuan. When we arrived at the island, we were able to explore the tropical marine life while snorkeling on the coral reef. Thailand is one of the best places in the world for snorkeling and diving; nowhere else in the world have I seen so many colorful fish and sea creatures! We really enjoyed this stop where we spent approximately one hour.
After a great lunch, we visited Koh Tao. Upon our arrival, we could already see the crystal clear water and the stunning hills. After reaching Koh Tao, we immediately hiked up to the viewpoint, which takes approximately 20 minutes. The hike was not very tough, but the heat and high humidity was quite a challenge; however, we arrived sweaty and happy to the top. We couldn’t believe our eyes, Koh Tao shines in different tones of blue and green and you really think you’re looking at a painting… that’s how beautiful it simply is!

After reaching the hotel we were exhausted but also totally happy about this amazing tour day. I can 100% recommend this tour! It is especially suited for sporty and active people.
We also used TripAdvisor to book a half day tour of Ko Samui island. If you are adventurous and like to have fun while meeting new people, this tour is for you!
To be honest: We were a bit skeptical in the beginning when we got picked up at the hotel with a 4×4 jeep without A/C. It was a very hot that day and we were quite sleepy so we expected to be able to rest a bit in a cool car.

Even though the car ride was hot, we would have never thought that this day would be one of the best days ever! Our first stops included a Buddha temple, a market, and a viewpoint. All of us were super eager though to reach the stop we were most excited for: The Na Muang Waterfall. It was absolutely stunning, and the cool thing about it is that there are waterslides right in the jungle (Some of them are very fast… the other ones are a bit slower). An inside tip, bring some cash, because it costs some baht to ride the slides.
After this cool experience we had a nice lunch, which was the perfect way to get to mingle with our tour group. It was a small group and we really got to know each other well and exchanged tons of fun stories!
Thailand is not only beautiful but also inspirational! It has become one of my favorite countries in the world and this trip was definitely not the last one.

"12","How do you decide which hotel to book, choose the perfect tour operator to show you around a new city or select a restaurant to dine in when celebrating a special event? With so many choices out there, it’s not easy, especially when you’re not familiar with a particular city or destination. Guidebooks can be great tools, but unless they’re online, they’re probably not up-to-date with current information.
My go-to site for traveler reviews has always been TripAdvisor. Even before we started traveling professionally, I relied on TripAdvisor to assist in the decision making process when booking hotels and restaurants for our own personal travel. So when we were invited to partner with them for this article, I of course, said yes. As the world’s largest travel site with more than 435 million reviews and opinions covering 6.8 million accommodations, restaurants and attractions, we find the information and reviews invaluable. The commentary on the overall experience, whether it’s regarding a tour guide, restaurant or hotel property, is usually spot-on advice. They also have a mobile app to assist with your planning while on the go. And now, when you’re ready to book, the site makes it easy to do just that.
* Know better. Book better. Go better.
TripAdvisor is more than just a place to read traveler reviews. You can actually plan your entire vacation using the tools and information they provide. Once you’ve decided on a destination and a hotel, TripAdvisor also compares hotels prices from more than 200 sites, helping you find the lowest hotel prices. You can often book it directly on TripAdvisor, or click to book it through one of their partners.  We like that they source all of the available deals and rates for your specific dates at hotels from other sites, so you can compare the offers. What we’ve found is that TripAdvisor will have either the lowest rate or match the lowest rate.
On a recent trip to Amelia Island, Florida over the Christmas holidays, we used TripAdvisor to select the property where we stayed, discover some of the best restaurants to dine in Fernandina Beach and plan excursions and places to visit during our time on the island.
Where We Stayed
Amelia Island, one of the barrier islands in the Sea Island chain in Northeastern Florida, is the perfect setting for a romantic getaway or family vacation. It had been many years since our last visit to this beautiful and quiet destination with its pristine sandy white beaches, marshlands and wildlife sanctuaries. After suddenly losing our sweet dog Beamer, just before his 15th birthday, we decided to spend Christmas at this unspoiled coastal destination rather than in our far too quiet house without him. The ocean has always had a special way of healing and we were certainly in need of that positive vibe over the holiday.
The Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort is the largest property on the island. Located on 1,350 acres at the southern tip of the island, the hotel has just over 400 rooms, all with views of the ocean. It sits within a large complex that includes a small village of shops and restaurants, a nature center, spa, and a state-of-the-art fitness center with an indoor pool; it also features outdoor activities such as fishing, kayaking and paddleboarding. A very family friendly resort, the Omni has a pool just for families and offers a kid’s camp, Camp Amelia. For couples visiting the property (sans kids), there is also an adult-only pool and plenty of activities for grownups to enjoy, including a game of tennis, biking on the beach or nature trails, a treatment at the spa or a round of golf. Avid golfers will appreciate the three golf courses designed by Pete Dye, Bobby Weed and Tom Fazio.
	

They also have a total of nine restaurants – everything from casual dining poolside during the day at Oceanside to a traditional American steakhouse, Bob’s Steak & Chop House, which serves prime meats and seafood. When we were choosing our dining options, we enlisted the advice of friends who live on the island as well as reading reviews on TripAdvisor. With limited restaurants open on Christmas day and larger meals being served at most places that were open, we opted for a casual spot, the Falcon’s Nest, a pub-style eatery, located in the shopping village at the Omni Resort. Not-to-be-missed are the chilled Fernandina shrimp. These delectable, locally caught shrimp deliver a slightly sweet flavor that is unique, and the wonderful seasoning they were marinated in made the flavors explode in our mouths. You won’t find these shrimp in your local supermarket, as the limited supply is provided only to island spots and restaurants. I found the reviews on TripAdvisor to be spot-on regarding this restaurant and others we chose during our stay.
	

Exploring Amelia Island
The lively historic downtown Fernandina Beach was a little quieter than normal during Christmas, but it was festively lit up at night to celebrate the holiday. The shops that line the streets are locally owned and aren’t filled with the touristy t-shirts, coffee mugs and shells you might find in other beach towns. There is also a surprisingly long list of excellent restaurants in the downtown area and on the rest of the island. For such a small town, we found the restaurants to be quite impressive. We enjoyed everything from well-prepared Mediterranean street food at Sabbia and great casual food at the Salty Pelican, to more elegant venues at The Ritz-Carlton (including their newly re-opened sushi and bourbon bar and their fine dining restaurant, Salt), as well as David’s Restaurant in downtown Fernandina Beach.
Additional activities, other than sunbathing on the beach (or sitting aside fire pits by the pool, as we did in December), worth pursuing are:
You can read more about things to do on Amelia Island at TripAdvisor.com.
Amelia Island is a great year-round vacation destination. The temperatures are moderate in the off-season months, so you can still get out and enjoy the beach, golf, boat trips and the downtown area. The rates are also more reasonable in the winter, early spring and late fall. It does get crowded during mid-March when one of the largest activities of the year takes place on the island, Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance, a car show reminiscent of the Pebble Beach car show in Carmel, California. If you want to experience those Fernandina shrimp, then be sure to visit in May 5-7 for the annual Shrimp Festival. You’ll also learn why Amelia is called the Isle of Eight Flags. With all the island has to offer, it is truly a special destination for a romantic getaway, wedding or honeymoon or family vacation, so make plans to visit Amelia Island for your next beach vacation."
"13","Known as the windy, wintry unofficial capital of the Midwest, this cosmopolitan city boasts stately streets (including the Magnificent Mile) famously lined with blockbuster buildings, many designed by world-renowned architects. The sheer number and variety of things to see can be overwhelming; fortunately, city sightseeing tours make stops at many of these landmarks, offering transportation and covering a lot ground in an organized way.
One of the city’s most famous structures, the Willis Tower stands proud at 108 stories and 1,450 feet (442.1 meters) tall. The skyscraper was originally one of the largest office buildings in the world, engineered by Fazlur Kahn with a collection of towers of varying heights. Today, you can dine atop the Willis Tower Skydeck, or, if you’d rather stay at street level, see the iconic structure during a small-group ‘best of Chicago’ city tour via minivan.
Traveler Tip: For something a little different, try a ghosts and gangsters kayaking tour on the Chicago River — you’ll paddle with a unique view of the tower looming above you and hear stories of the city’s dark secrets from your guide.
Another Fazlur Kahn–engineered building with a competing observatory, the John Hancock Center is located in the heart of the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Avenue. At 100 stories and 1,128 feet (343.7 meters) tall, the building features the 360 Chicago observation deck with views of up to four surrounding states and 80 miles (130 km) away.
Traveler Tip: Book an admission ticket in advance so you don’t miss out! Choose a ticket that includes a half bottle of prosecco to salute Chicago skyline with, or visit as part of a sightseeing tour of the Windy City.
The stunning Chicago Cultural Center was originally built more than a century ago as Chicago’s first public library and a Civil War memorial. Today, it’s host to an ever-rotating roster of free cultural events showcasing Chicago’s music, dance, art, and literature. Two enormous glass domes cap the building’s roof; one is the largest Tiffany stained glass dome in the world at 38 feet (11.5 meters) in diameter and more than 30,000 individual pieces of glass.
Traveler Tip: Visit this showstopper on foot — choose between a Cultural Mile walking tour, a walking tour of the city’s Tiffany art glass landmarks, and a Chicago Loop walking tour that visits several indoor and outdoor architectural sites.
The Frederick C. Robie House is considered one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s masterpieces, a stellar example of the Prairie School style of architecture. You can start to recognize the Prairie style in Midwestern buildings like Robie House in the use of horizontal lines, flat roofs with eaves and a clean, natural approach to construction. Robie commissioned the house for his young family more than a century ago.
Traveler Tip: Entrance is included with the Chicago Explorer Pass, which also offers admission to other attractions all over the city.
Yes, D.C. is packed with important landmarks (hello, White House and Washington Monument), but not to be outdone by its Midwestern rival, the city also features a number of lesser-known architectural stunners. See them and more on one of the many city sightseeing tours available in the US capital.
The Washington National Cathedral has a hard-earned position on the list of D.C.’s architectural gems — it took 83 years to complete. The sixth-largest cathedral in the world, this enormous building is dripping with ornate architectural details and historical character. There’s even a gargoyle of Darth Vader; bring binoculars if you want to find it.
Traveler Tip: Learn how to take epic travel photos of this and other city landmarks on a Washington D.C. photo safari, or see the cathedral lit up after dark on a city night tour.
Designed by architect Daniel Burnham, D.C.’s Union Station has been in operation for more than a century. The station’s National Historic Landmark status can be partly attributed to the Main Hall’s soaring ceiling, which is divided into five bays and decorated with gleaming gold leaf. This immense space sees throngs of travelers passing through every day, many headed for destinations further afield via rail or bus.
Traveler Tip: Take a different tack and arrive at Union Station on a bike tour around the capital’s top sites or in an amphibious vehicle during a popular sightseeing Duck tour.
A collaboration between architectural firms Notter, Finegold & Alexander; Mariani & Associates; and Bryant & Bryant, the stately Reagan Building was completed in 1993 as the first federal building constructed for both government and private sector uses. Today, it’s used for events, meetings, and daily government work, and the exterior is a popular sight to see among travelers. View its limestone facade, vertical glass windows, and terracotta roof tiles on a 3-hour sightseeing coach tour that hits D.C.’s landmarks and architectural gems in one fell swoop.
Traveler Tip: Opt for a new perspective with a night tour of D.C. that leaves your day free for other activities.
Completed in 1899 as a prime example of Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style (think arches, recessed entrances and cylindrical towers reminiscent of castles), the Old Post Office Pavilion served as D.C.’s main post office for nearly 20 years. This national landmark escaped teardown several times throughout history in attempts to make room for the Federal Triangle. See the remarkable 315-foot (96-meter) clock tower and immense glass atrium on a pedicab tour of the National Mall.
Traveler Tip: Cruise by during a twilight tour and take advantage of the “golden hour” lighting for  the best possible photos of D.C. It’s also free to climb to the top of the tower for some of the best views in D.C.
 Chicago is lauded as a city full of architectural history, and the buildings and landmarks listed here support that claim. But D.C.’s architectural gems offer special significance in American history. 
The winner of this architectural city vs. city showdown? Simply put, it really depends on the kind of traveler you are! Architecture purists may find Chicago’s offerings more up their alley, while history buffs will likely appreciate the historically significant buildings in our nation’s capital. 
So tell us: what’s your pick? Share your thoughts on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Happy travels!

"14","TripAdvisor is the world’s largest online provider of bookable experiences, tours, and activities. Our new report showcases some of the top 2018 tourism trends for the experiences segment. TripAdvisor bookings data revealed that iconic sites remain wildly popular, while travelers are expanding their horizons and bringing growth to new, non-traditional and experiential categories.
Travelers are becoming increasingly interested in new experiences, but they’re still loyal to the world’s most iconic sites. In 2017, the most-booked experiences globally were a combined skip-the-line pass for the Vatican Museums, St. Peters, and Sistine Chapel, the Chicago River Architecture Cruise, and a skip-the-line pass for a walking tour of Ancient Rome and the Colosseum. Bookable options for The Sagrada Familia, Eiffel Tower, and the Empire State Building also featured in the top ten (full list below).
Globally, travelers are expanding their horizons, and several categories grew quickly in 2017.  Historic and heritage experiences (such as a Charleston Harbor History Tour and a Tour of Historic Fenway Park) saw the most growth (+125% in bookings), and culinary is a clear trend: cooking classes and food tours both appeared among the top five categories, each with 57% bookings’ growth. By gross booking value, food tours saw the most growth in 2017.
In line with global trends, US bookings placed cooking classes and food tours in the top ten, with 51% and 49% growth respectively. An interactive Spanish Cooking Experience in Barcelona where travelers learn to make paella and Spanish tapas with a local chef, and a guided Street Food Tour in Rome with pizza, pastries, and sightseeing, were among the fastest growing experiences for US and global travelers.
Historical and heritage experiences may have topped the list of fastest-growing categories for US travelers (+98% in bookings), but aquatic activities dominated the top ten, taking half of the top spots. Sunset cruises (+89% in bookings), snorkeling (+64%), sailing trips (+55%), catamaran cruises (+51%), and kayaking and canoeing experiences (+49%) all ranked in the year’s fastest-growing categories.
Skip-the-line access at some of the world’s busiest landmarks and sites (like the Colosseum) appeared in both the most-popular and fastest-growing lists for global travelers.
New options range from entry tickets for famous sites to cooking classes, day cruises, and multi-day adventure tours. Options are expanding quickly, and a trolley tour of Newport’s famous mansions, a combination tour of Tulum’s ruins and snorkel trip in the cenotes, and a full-day tour of Abu Dhabi from Dubai are among the most popular new experiences.
“We’re seeing more travelers balancing their itineraries with a mix of classic sightseeing and more unique local experiences,” said Laurel Greatrix, director of communications. “Of course travelers heading to Rome want to explore the Vatican and the Sistine Chapel, but they’re also booking experiences like food tours to enhance their trip, and see the city like a local.”
“Travelers are also being more economical with their time,” Greatrix continued. “Skip-the-line tour options are among the fastest-growing tours in the world, and were among the fastest growing categories for US travelers in particular, allowing travelers to see more than just the back of someone’s head.”

"15","Many 18-year-olds are focused on graduating high school, getting part time jobs and generally just starting to figure out life. James Asquith was setting out on a journey around the world.
The London native and resident, now 28-years-old, grew up with a pilot for a father, so travel is in his blood. When he was a teen he began going on trips with his dad. At age 18, he took a gap year with friends and did the “classic Southeast backpacking thing.”
That’s when he got the travel bug.
He decided to set a new Guinness World Record: the youngest person to visit all sovereign countries.
After five years, at age 24, he had done it. Asquith completed his journey to 196 countries on July 8, 2013 when he arrived in his final country, Federated States of Micronesia.

Asquith traveled alone to some countries and had company in others. His time spent in different places varied as well; he spent months in places like Brazil, Peru and Vietnam and less time in places like North Korea where “you see what they want you to see.”
He experienced “total relaxation” in the Maldives and war and conflict in Afghanistan, the Ivory Coast and Libya.  But all of the experiences taught him valuable lessons about himself and the world, he said.
“Everyone should travel. It broadens your horizons and experiences. It’s the best thing I’ll ever do,” he said. “ To have a perspective on cultures, religions, foods–it makes you understand and be more tolerant to others.”

“We’re all so similar no matter where you are.”
After taking a bit of a break to regroup and write a book, the travel bug is back. Asquith has begun traveling again to favorite spots and places he had never been to like Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. He hopes to get to the North and South Pole, Easter Island and Tahiti.
“No one is ever going to experience the whole world, he said, “The culture, arts…there is so much more to keep seeing.”
As for his favorite places? If he had to choose, Asquith picks the United States for the variety of landscape, Italy for the food, Iran for the surprise of how much he had in common with the people and Latin America for just about everything else.

“I love Latin American culture,” he said. “the cobble stone streets, the atmosphere, laughing, having a good time, drinking rum, live music and the passion of the people.”
(Another top spot: The South Pacific, but more on that later)
We caught up with Asquith (while he was at the airport on his way to Rome, of course) to pick his brain for travel tips, budget expertise and general wisdom about the world.

“[Traveling] can be daunting at first, and it certainly was for me,” he said. While the world can seem like a scary place, Asquith says you just have to “keep your wits about you.”
“Say ‘yes’ more to everything, and have patience. Things don’t work like you think they work in every country, so have an open mind and want to learn.”

“It can be fun when you start to get to know a destination before you arrive,” he said.
Asquith used TripAdvisor to book hotels and restaurants. “It’s the place to go for people that want reviews and tips on almost everywhere and everything.” His favorite feature is the traveler photos because they give you an authentic look at what you’re getting yourself into as professional photos can be deceiving.
 “It’s nice to get confidence,” he said.
 Research can also help you save some money if you find out on which days museums offer free entrance or when the best happy hours are.

“It was amazing how little money could get you around. The main big-ticket item is the flight,” Asquith said. But if you’re flexible with time and destination, you can get around that. There are tools that allow you to not only search for “any destination” on flight comparison sites, but that also allow you to search over a wide time period spanning a month.
Work while you’re abroad
Asquith worked at a beach bar in Peru and got free accommodations, food and drink and a small wage each day. He also recommends staying at hostels and asking around if anyone has any odd jobs available.
Eat street food
“Simple street food is amazing,” he said. “Particularly in Asia, the street food is incredible and rivals the best restaurants.” You can also cook your own food in the kitchen at hostels.
Take free tours
Asquith is a fan of free walking tours and attractions with free admission. “In the majority of cities a lot of the attractions are quite bunched together, so even if you can’t find free walking tours then plan it out yourself.”

Asquith says, hands down, the best part of traveling is the people you meet. “At the end of the day, the best memories are when we stayed in villages and walked back home the same route every night. The local people would invite us into their houses. We would have three or four meals in one night. And they didn’t speak English,” he said. “We all laugh at the same silly things.”

This was the hardest part for Asquith. He spent three months in West Africa where no one spoke English and he had limited access to technology. War-torn countries were a struggle as well, though he said he wouldn’t want to see them with a partner because “you’re always on the alert.” “It’s a whole new level,” he said. “But you deal with it.”
At the same time, sometimes being alone is great, he says. One morning, Asqith says he was the first person in the world to watch the sunrise. He was on a small island in the Central Pacific called Kiribati. Depending on the time of year, it’s the first place that sees the sun in the morning.
“The solitude is awesome because you love and appreciate that it’s your own moment,” he said “And also you want to share it in the future with someone else.”

“The south Pacific is particularly special because, coming from the UK, it’s pretty much as far away from home as you can get. It’s like you drill a hole through the earth,” he said. “Everything grows there and it’s so warm and humid all the time,” he said. “People have fruit falling off their trees. They’re just happy.”
And each country has its own quirk.
For example, in Tuvalu, the plane runway is the center of the community. There are very few flights in and out of the island, so for most of the time, it’s a “playground.” Asquith said he saw people play soccer and volleyball on it and at night, because it’s so hot, people drag their mattresses out there to sleep."
"16","Iguazu Falls (also known as Iguassu Falls or Iguaçu Falls) is a once-in-a-lifetime destination—so, of course, you’ll want to get it right. Here’s everything you need to know about when to go, where to stay and how to make the most of your visit.
Waterfalls, of course—and lots of them. In fact, Iguazu Falls is home to nearly 300 cascades, most of which lie on the Argentine side. This means that the trails on the Brazilian side provide panoramic views of the falls across the water, and the Argentine side’s Upper and Lower Circuit trails, each about 1 mile (1.6 km) long, wind up, down and around the cascades, allowing for close-up experiences.
As suggested by its name, the flat, wheelchair-accessible Upper Circuit sits above the falls, giving you the unique perspective of looking down over the rushing water. The Lower Circuit, also aptly named, begins at a set of stairs and leads to the bottom of some of the cascades, including Bosetti Waterfall.
There’s also the park’s showstopping main attraction: the monstrous, 260-foot (80-meter) Garganta del Diablo (Devil’s Throat). In Brazil, a lookout point offers a sweeping view of Devil’s Throat, while in Argentina, you can take the Jungle Train and follow a short series of boardwalks to stand right at the mouth of Iguazu’s most powerful waterfall.
Although the roaring falls could captivate you for days, you’ll also have the chance to:
No matter which country you’re staying in, be sure to make time for both sides. Most visitors spend a half day soaking up views in Brazil and at least one or two full days in Argentina, exploring the trails and even taking a boat ride through the falls.
From Foz do Iguaçu, you can choose a guided tour of the Brazilian side or of the Argentine side. The same goes for travelers coming from Puerto Iguazu—book a tour of the falls in Argentina and another of the Brazilian side, or, if you’re tight on time, knock out both sides in one day. 
Those looking for adventure can get some thrills on a combo tour featuring off-roading, hiking and a waterfall boat ride. And if you’re looking for an extra special experience, consider booking a panoramic helicopter flight over the falls from Foz do Iguaçu.
To leave all the planning and details to someone else, book a multi-day tour from Buenos Aires, with transportation by plane or bus.
Iguazu Falls is near the equator, so there’s no real bad time to visit! Summertime (December to March) brings the warmest temperatures but also the most rain, which means that you’ll see the falls at their most powerful (although the extra water also sometimes causes trail closures). Be prepared for hotels and tours to book up quickly at the tail end of the season.
Even winter (July to September), the coolest time of year, still sees an average daytime high around 78°F (25°C)—just be prepared for slightly cooler evenings. And know that many locals take a midwinter vacation in July, which can result in bigger crowds.

When it comes to the time of day, the Devil’s Throat is quietest in the early morning, though photography conditions are best in the late afternoon. Stick to the early morning for the Upper and Lower Circuits as well, when you’ll enjoy smaller crowds and ideal lighting as the sun rises from the Brazilian side and illuminates the falls.
Due to its remote location, most visitors travel to Iguazu Falls by plane. You can either fly into Puerto Iguazu in Argentina (a 2-hour flight from Buenos Aires), or Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil (a 2-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro). It’s easy to explore the falls from both countries’ gateway towns.
It’s said that the falls are in Argentina, but the views are in Brazil. That means both sides have their perks—but the best perk of all is that you can easily cross the border and visit both, no matter where you stay. Just be sure to check visa requirements before you go, and keep in mind that you’ll need to pay entry fees on both sides since each country technically hosts a separate national park.
Although there’s one hotel inside Argentina’s Iguazu National Park, most other lodging options are set in the nearby town of Puerto Iguazu—a convenient place to stay, but not much of a destination in itself.
Inside the Park
Sheraton Iguazu Resort & Spa  – “If your travels take you to Iguazu (which they should) you must stay at this hotel. This is the only hotel physically located inside the Argentinean part of the national park. You can literally walk outside the hotel and begin exploring the various trails.” –TripAdvisor traveler FreqTrvl75
Hotels Nearby
Iguazu Grand Resort, Spa & Casino – “The Iguazu Grand Resort Spa and Casino lives up to its name with grand style and comfort in a resort environment. This is the perfect place to enjoy a relaxing holiday close to the magnificent Iguazu Falls in Brazil and Argentina.” –TripAdvisor traveler TravellerRoy
La Aldea de la Selva Lodge – “We spent 2 nights here while visiting Iguazu Falls, what a hidden oasis this turned out to be. Small cabins set in the rainforest, with individual balconies. So peaceful and tranquil.” –TripAdvisor traveler BasesinPlaces
The Iguaçu National Park gateway city of Foz do Iguaçu hosts most hotels on the Brazilian side of the falls and features a few more attractions than its Argentine counterpart. One hotel is set inside the Brazilian park.
Inside the Park
Belmond Hotel das Cataratas – “This is the only hotel in the park on the Brazilian side of the falls. You can see some of the falls from the hotel entrance and you have access to the falls before and after the tourist buses. This alone makes it the perfect place to stay.” –TripAdvisor traveler jen138
Hotels Nearby
Wish Resort Foz do Iguaçu – “Good location, near the airport and the falls. Staff hotel really cares about giving a good service. Large rooms, beautiful gardens.” –TripAdvisor traveler azazueta
San Martin Hotel & Resort – “Great hotel, very close to the entrance of Iguacu Park (it takes around 10 minutes by foot to get there) and to the airport. Good free shuttle from and to the airport (but make sure you call them in advance!) and fantastic breakfast.” –TripAdvisor traveler cdragan
In addition to comfortable clothes and walking shoes, there are a few extra things you’ll need for a seamless visit to the falls:

"17","As travelers, we’re all citizens of the same world – and while we’re on our own journeys, we can also make a difference for others. That’s the inspiration behind the Wear Your World bracelet created by Lokai and TripAdvisor. Each purchase benefits the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an organization providing urgently-needed support to refugee families and individuals across the globe.
To bring this mission to life, we partnered with Lokai Circle Members and insanely popular Instagrammers Jack Morris (@doyoutravel) and Lauren Bullen (@gypsea_lust) on a Balance Trip to Kenya, home to one of the world’s largest refugee populations. During their trip, Jack and Lauren visited refugee communities to see the IRC’s work firsthand, then used TripAdvisor to discover more of what Kenya has to offer. Below, they share highlights of their journey.
By Jack Morris (@doyoutravel) and Lauren Bullen (@gypsea_lust)
The first community we visited was called Eastleigh and it is home to people who’ve fled decades of war in Somalia. The local refugee community was extremely engaging and showed us how the IRC had helped them to rebuild their lives.  We were invited into the homes of women who were involved in programs put together by the IRC.
Many of the women in the community had been to beauty college, where they specialized in henna tattoos. We had an amazing opportunity to see their skills at work. While the artists created masterpieces across the hands and arms of group members, we were able to form a connection and feel comfortable around each other. We took a few photos before sitting back down to hear some of their stories.

Their stories were heartbreaking yet touching; it was amazing to hear about the different ways the IRC has helped support them and make positive progress in rebuilding their lives. A few of the women we met had taken a course and were eligible for loans to start their own businesses; some of them created an at home henna service, where they would travel to people’s homes to apply henna for special occasions.
Our next stop was a visit to communities that were home to refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, many of whom were forced from their homes by violence and conflict. This group was a mixture of men and women who had started their own businesses with the help of the IRC’s business loan program.
We met a woman who made the most delicious homemade peanut butter and another woman had started a bakery and made homemade cakes; she was kind enough to give us a taste of her delectable creations. During this tasting, we were able to chat about their businesses and learn more about their daily practices that keep their businesses running strong. This conversation introduced us to two men who had businesses within the same market; they supplied fresh and prepared fish to the community. It was amazing to see how each individual entrepreneur within this market had a fascinating story to tell.
Overall, this part of our trip was insightful and eye-opening. It was great to see how people have come so far in rebuilding their lives with the help from the IRC and their volunteers.

The next day of our journey started with a private hiking day trip to Mount Longonot from Nairobi, which we booked right on TripAdvisor. We headed to Mount Longonot, a stratovolcano located southeast of Lake Naivasha in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya.
It was an early departure, starting off with a beautiful African sunrise. We stopped at a scenic lookout, overlooking the breathtaking Great Rift Valley.

Once we arrived at the park, we picked up our tour guide, Benjamin, who led us on our hike. Within the first few minutes of the hike up Mount Longonot, we spotted zebra, waterbuck, warthogs, and antelopes. It was incredible to be in the same environment as these beautiful animals and to capture images of them in their natural habitat.

It had taken us about 45 minutes to reach the top of the crater where we were able to walk around. It is still an active volcano and from certain locations, you can see steam coming through the cracks. The view across the valley was outstanding and we could even see views of Lake Naivasha, which was the next stop on our journey.
We were provided with a delicious lunch at Lake Naivasha; this fueled us up for an amazing boat tour around the lake. The highlight was seeing hippopotamuses. We had our own private boat and within minutes of starting the trip we spotted a family of hippos in the water just a few feet in front of us. At first, they were hard to spot with just their heads and eyes peeking out of the water.
As our day wrapped up and we were on our way back from the boat tour, we spotted some hippos that had come out of the water. It was really great to be able to see them out of the water and to see how big they really were. It was an overall amazing experience!

On the third day of our Kenya trip, we paid a visit to The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, the only elephant orphanage within the city of Nairobi (which we found on TripAdvisor). We spent our morning meeting some of the largest mammals on earth and learned about their lives and how they survive in the wild. The orphanage is only open to the public for one hour a day; our visit took place during feeding time, where we had the opportunity to learn more about the elephants and what the organization is doing to help these animals.
These orphan elephants were all rescued from the wild; some are either injured, or their parents have been poached. Whichever reason it may be, The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was formed to rescue and rehabilitate wildlife and is one of the pioneering conservation organizations for wildlife and habitat protection in east Africa. The orphanage has amazing success stories of rehabilitating and releasing the elephants back into the wild. Definitely a sight to see and worth going to!

"18","With three staff members for every guest at this TripAdvisor Travelers’ Choice winner on Mexico’s Caribbean coast, help is never far away: The pool attendant will shine your sunglasses, your personal butler will lay out your toiletries, and the bartender will make sure that your glass is always full. The rooms are spread across three sections—Zen Grand is tucked into the mangroves, Ambassador wraps around the largest of the three pools, and the beachfront Grand Class is reserved for those 16 years old and up. The cuisine shines here, with eight restaurants that serve everything from Mexican favorites to molecular gastronomy; while many all-inclusives charge an additional fee to dine at their fanciest restaurants, here all eight are included in the room rate. At the Grand Velas, everything is built on a truly grand scale (the spa is the largest in Latin America), so you never feel crunched for space, even when all 539 rooms are occupied.
At the Cousteau Resort (another Travelers’ Choice winner), the staff doesn’t just expect you to go off-property; they literally welcome you into their village. In fact, five field trips per week are included in the room rate: In addition to the village visit, you can hike to a waterfall, explore a mangrove forest with the resident marine biologist, visit the nearby farmers’ market, or watch a class at the local elementary school. In keeping with the resort’s commitment to sustainability—the son of famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau helped develop the resort’s focus on creating economic benefits for the local community while preserving the natural environment—the luxurious bures, or traditional thatched bungalows, utilize louvered windows to keep the rooms cool without air-conditioning. The complimentary Bula Club turns the tables on the typical resort’s kids’ program: Here, rather than plopping the children in front of a screen, the youngest guests are taught about Fijian culture and environmental stewardship.
Think all-inclusives are just a way to bask on the beach? Think again. The motto at this Travelers’ Choice winner is rough it by day, and sop up luxury by night. It sits at the edge of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth, and the room rate includes daily small-group guided excursions by foot, 4×4, bicycle, and horseback. You can even summit an 18,645-foot volcano and be back in time for a late lunch with a glass of fine Chilean wine. With so much to do, the challenge is finding enough time to relax by the pool or enjoy a massage at the spa. Every room has a spacious private terrace, perfect for stargazing in this region known for its clear skies (ideally when there is not a full moon, notes traveler Cedar32).
The Maasai Mara National Reserve is one of Africa’s iconic safari destinations—so popular, sadly, that it is often choked with tourists. Leave the crowds behind by staying at the nearby Mara Plains Camp, ensconced in a 30,000-acre private conservancy; on the morning, afternoon, and nighttime game drives that are included in your room rate, you’re likely to be the only vehicle in sight; also included are visits to a local Maasai village. At Mara Plains, you’ll enjoy that classic canvas tented adventure: The seven raised rooms have been built without cement, limiting their environmental impact while offering you all the creature comforts. With so few guests, the staff is nimble enough to arrange special experiences such as a private dinner on your tree-top deck; they’ll even loan you a professional DSLR camera, remarked several TripAdvisor travelers.
The Dominican Republic probably has more all-inclusive resorts than any other country on earth, and the one that rises to the top of the heap for our travelers is the Zoetry Agua Punta Cana, a Travelers’ Choice winner. The rates include meals at four different on-site gourmet restaurants and at several sister properties, top-shelf alcohol, three-times-a-day maid service, WiFi and international calling to the U.S. and Canada, and (once each per stay) a 45-minute horseback ride and a 20-minute massage. Our travelers agree that this is a quiet place best for romantic getaways and honeymoons rather than partiers or families (there is no kids’ club), and the high level of service is proven by the fact that many of our travelers refer to their favorite bartenders, butlers, and waiters by name.
Fishing is the main attraction at this all-inclusive lodge half an hour from Ketchikan, the “salmon capital of the world.” If the premier angling isn’t enough for you (or your traveling companion), there’s also sea kayaking, hiking, whale-watching, lawn games, and nearby zip-lining to keep everyone occupied. You don’t even have to bring a pole; fishing equipment, bait, gear, and fish processing (so that you can bring your catch home) is included in the rates, along with meals and airport transfers. The log cabin-style rooms are rustic enough to fit in with the surroundings but have been recently upgraded with all the mod cons you won’t find at most fishing camps, and traveler after traveler praises the quality of the cuisine—particularly the Alaskan seafood chowder, says ColoradoVagabond—and the décor at the restaurant.
Located in Belek, a resort town on the Mediterranean coast, the Cornelia Diamond has something for everyone: a 27-hole golf course designed by Nick Faldo; clay, artificial grass, and hard tennis courts; a luxurious spa with Turkish baths; a private beach with watersports; numerous restaurants; and regular evening performances of dance, acrobatics, and more. Children will be delighted by the kids’ area, which includes indoor and outdoor playgrounds, pools with water slides, and even a merry-go-round and bumper cars. Many of the rooms connect directly to the pool from their terraces for easy access, but the consensus among our travelers is that the sea-view rooms are the ones to book. Here’s another helpful hint from TripAdvisor traveler 5c0778: “Keep it to yourself, but the pier has the best sun loungers and gives you the best chance of a cooling breeze off the sea.”

"19","Pocket-sized Bruges punches above its weight, offering some of the most ornate Gothic architecture in the world. Picturesque canals and cobbled streets hark back hundreds of years ago when Bruges was considered the most powerful city in northern Europe. Its streets are lined with 15th-century mansions filled with art collections by Picasso, the Flemish Old Masters, and Salvador Dali, such as the Groeningemuseum. For a medieval time-warp, this little city is surprisingly forward-looking, with museums of chocolate, beer, and French fries competing for the attention of travelers alongside interactive historical exhibits at the Historium. Check out the best of Bruges on a two-hour private tour led by a local.
Denmark’s compact capital city is one of the greenest cities in Europe and the perfect destination for vacationing families with kids thanks to its easy-going vibe, dedicated cycle lanes (hop on a city bike tour to take advantage), and free public transportation. Surrounding the 17th-century Nyhavn harbor area, Copenhagen offers up candy-colored houses and romantic castles such as Rosenborg to explore, as well as nostalgic fairground rides at Tivoli Gardens and the landmark Copenhagen Zoo with its fine conservation record. Copenhagen has form in the cultural stakes as well, with superb art collections, dramatic contemporary waterfront architecture for the Copenhagen Opera House, and a thriving, sophisticated nightlife. Explore the vibrant city on foot with a small-group walking tour.
No longer the “Auld Reekie” of yesteryear, Edinburgh has dropped its unfavorable nickname and now crackles with festivals, museums, shops, clubs, and restaurants. This is a city of two halves—there’s the jumble of (possibly haunted!) Old Town tenement buildings dotting the Royal Mile around the Gothic Edinburgh Castle, and the genteel symmetry of the 17th-century Georgian New Town, neatly arranged in grid form and lined with enviable homes and designer stores. Blessed with a unique location sprawled over volcanic plugs and overlooking the sea, Edinburgh boasts a spooky history and a hilly landscape for its many attractions. See both the underground and above-ground highlights that make this city so special on a two-hour walking tour led by a guide dressed in 17th-century costume.
With Poland making its mark on the itineraries of travelers in the know, Krakow offers a wide range of funky bars and clubs, plus a rising trend in gastronomic excellence. The city’s baroque-era beauty can be seen all around the Main Market Square (the largest medieval square in Europe), as well as from Wawel Royal Castle, where Poland’s rulers governed for five centuries. Check out the trendy Kazimierz district and sample traditional Polish dishes on a 3.5-hour food tour.
Currently enjoying a tourism boom, Lisbon is a city of contrasts. Quaintly old-fashioned but constantly modernizing, it edges the River Tagus with a mixture of architecture styles showcased in the ornate, baroque Belém Tower (Torre de Belém), the National Tile Museum, and the ultra-contemporary Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology (MAAT). Creeping inland up winding hills topped with Moorish castles and citadels, Lisbon’s mysterious alleyways reveal modern art galleries beside traditional bakers, designer stores flanking flea markets, and age-old cafés that echo with the sounds of mournful fado music. For a dose of Portuguese culture and a fun night out, book tickets to a live fado show in the Chiado neighborhood.
The 2013 opening of the spectacular Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations (MuCEM) was just one sign that the southern France port city of Marseille is a destination worth keeping an eye on—it’s an enticing, multicultural metropolis where kebab shops exist alongside gourmet seafood restaurants and contemporary seafront architecture contrasts with the centuries-old, labyrinthine alleys of The Panier, a historic quarter at the heart of Marseille. Add the city’s calanques (narrow inlet beaches) and the myriad delights of the entire Provence region and you have an irresistible French Riviera destination to add to your European bucket list. Join an electric bike tour to take in the city and coast in style.
Possibly the most eye-catching city in central Europe, Prague is known for its stellar architecture, featuring cobbled streets crammed with baroque churches, Gothic spires, Art Nouveau mansions, and gabled houses in pastel shades. Overlooking all this majesty is Prague Castle, Europe’s largest medieval castle and cathedral complex. Book a small-group city walking tour to explore the Old Town Square, Wenceslas Square, and the colorful Havel’s Market, all before setting out on a Vltava River cruise.
Now on the roster of must-see European cities for its unspoiled baroque beauty, Vilnius has grown around its UNESCO-listed Old Town. Tucked in between the Neris and Vilnelė rivers, the capital of Lithuania is stuffed with ornate Gothic, baroque, and Renaissance buildings, fairytale churches, and pastel façades, all watched over by the castle complex perched atop Castle Hill. Another good spot from which to see the layout of the city is the viewing platform at the Vilnius TV Tower, with the concrete blocks of the Soviet-built city standing starkly on the horizon. Take a 3-hour guided walking tour to discover the bohemian neighborhood of Uzupis and top landmarks such as St. Anne’s Church.
Often overlooked for the Venetian delights of Dubrovnik, Zagreb is a city of two intriguing halves. The Upper Town (Gornji Grad) is a tangle of flower-strewn baroque alleys centered around St. Mark’s Church and its tiled roof, the ornate twin spires of the Cathedral of the Assumption, and the rambling, colorful Dolac Market, all of which is connected to the grandiose Lower Town via a funicular. This part of Zagreb features verdant parks and a peerless number of museums and galleries. Discover most sides of the city on a private walking tour, or perhaps make time for the charming Museum of Broken Relationships.

Somerset, UK, June 21–25
Every July, Glastonbury — the undisputed holy grail of British festivals — transforms a sleepy Somerset town into a colorful carnival attended by 175,000 revelers. Undeterred by almost guaranteed rain and mud, festival fans flock to the village of Pilton to watch some of music’s biggest names perform live. This year’s headliners include Glastonbury veterans Radiohead, the Foo Fighters, and Ed Sheeran.
If you’re not camping, consider staying in the nearby hub of Bath, where you’ll find a number of hotels and inns, restaurants, and things to do. Take on an extra day for a full-day tour of Glastonbury or a lunchtime cruise on the River Avon.

Boom, Belgium, July 21–30
With its intense energy and exuberant decor, Tomorrowland is the undeniable front-runner of dance music festivals. Aside from the lineup of dance, house, and trance legends, you can also expect fireworks, staggering set design, and the major sense of unity that connects Tomorrowland’s 185,000 attendees.
Many festival-goers opt to spend a day or two exploring Antwerp or Brussels before heading to the festival; don’t miss the brews at Billie’s Bier Kafetaria in Antwerp or the Grand Place in central Brussels.

Paris, France, July 22–23; Chicago, USA, August 3–6; Berlin, Germany; September 9–10
Various, August 3–6
While other festivals have diversified their lineups with comedy, poetry, and other creative endeavors, Lollapalooza has remained solely dedicated music. Having recently extended from three to four days, the festival — held in Chicago, Berlin, and Paris — promises to please every musical palate with performances from Chance The Rapper, Blink 182, DJ Snake, and The xx.
If attending Lollapalooza Chicago, also check the Willis Tower Skydeck and The Bean at Millennium Park off your bucket list.
These festivals defy conventions with their eclectic lineups and artistic foundations. Prepare to be surprised and stimulated.

Nevada, USA, August 27–September 4
Less of a music festival and more of a social experiment, Burning Man throws out the usual festival conventions by focusing on communal efforts and prohibiting attendees from using money (goods can only be gifted or exchanged). The vast Nevada desert provides an enchanting backdrop for the giant art installations, costumes, and performances of Black Rock City — the name given to the fleeting and fantastical metropolis that appears for the festival’s eight days.
Some burners choose to fly into Reno International Airport — stop for a meal at Peg’s Glorified Ham n Eggs or the Great Full Gardens Cafe and Eatery before driving off into the desert.

Budapest, Hungary, August 9–16
Sziget Festival, aka the Island of Freedom, presents a lineup combining indie rock, pop, and dance on the Danube River’s Hajógyári Island in Budapest. Dedicated to showcasing the work of young artists, the festival grounds display a number of art installations and sculptures. Plus, Sziget’s next-level performing arts program features bearded acrobats, naked ballet dancers, a herd of mechanical creatures, and a few fire shows scattered over seven days.
To unwind after Sziget, get a new view of the river on a Danube dinner cruise or opt for private entry to Budapest’s famous Szechenyi Spa.

Dorset, UK, September 7–10
The brainchild of radio legend Rob da Bank, Bestival unfurls at a wooded country estate on Dorset’s Jurassic Coast. Each year, a predominate theme (past themes include Freaks Under the Sea, Desert Island Disco, and Out of Space) encourages festival-goers to capture the Bestival’s wild spirit with outlandish costumes. This year, in addition to performances from A Tribe Called Quest and the Pet Shop Boys, Bestival is adding an enormous confetti cannon, an inflatable church, a carnival day parade, and free haircuts to its lineup.
If you’d rather not camp, consider staying in nearby Wareham.

Budget-friendly and just beginning to encroach onto the mainstream festival scene, these unique celebrations are ideal for jaded festival-goers ready for a refresh.
Reykjavik, Iceland, June 15–18
Capitalizing on Iceland’s staggering beauty and unique season of continuous daylight, Secret Solstice (the Midnight Sun Music Festival) allows hardcore revelers to party for days on end. Set in the heart of Reykjavik, the intimate festival promises esoteric dance acts, chill Icelandic vibes, and 72 hours of endless sunlight.
Use some of those extra daylight hours to soak at the Blue Lagoon, grab a slice at the Pizza Place With No Name, or climb to the top of the famous Hallgrimskirkja.
Katowice, Poland, July 6–9
In the dystopian setting of an underground coal mine-turned-museum, Festiwal Tauron Nowa Muzyka bursts to life with US rappers, soul divas, and techno legends. Like Katowice, the festival’s host city, Tauron Nowa Muzyka is the epitome of cutting-edge avant-garde — empty warehouses and deserted industrial facilities provide the perfect place for ravers to express themselves.
Stay at the Novotel Katowice Centrum or the Ibis Budget Katowice Centrum to be based right across the street from the festival.
Rhodope Mountains, Bulgaria, June 9–11
Serene and secluded, Meadow in the Mountains is a breath of fresh air for the festival scene. Set amid the lush landscapes of Bulgaria’s Rhodope Mountains and inspired by Burning Man, the environmentally friendly celebration combines nature with music, art, and food. A major plus? Included in the standard ticket price is an evening at a rural spa, perfect for soothing aching muscles.
If flying into Sofia Airport, squeeze in a traditional Bulgarian breakfast and city tour before driving four hours into the mountains.

"21","In a city like Las Vegas, sexy shows featuring scantily clad performers are nothing new. That is unless you are talking about Magic Mike Live, the stage version of the hit movie released in 2012. The film’s star Channing Tatum is the man behind the male revue show. His goal: Make it something that women really want to see. As it turns out, that includes comedy.
Enter the emcee of Magic Mike Live, Lyndsay Hailey. The Los Angeles-based comedian makes sure guests get the most out of the 90-minute act with jokes and commentary that are catered to a mostly female crowd. We caught up with the hostess with the mostess at the Hard Rock Hotel before a show to talk about the guys, what her mom thinks she does for work and where to find the best seat in the house. 

TripAdvisor: What was it like auditioning for the role? Was Channing Tatum there?  Lyndsay Hailey: The audition process was intense. There were four rounds and we had to create new content with strict time requirements. It was super thrilling and the most intense audition process I’ve had to date. Channing was there for parts of it.  
TA: As the show’s writer, what goes into writing a script like this, especially when you are also the person delivering jokes to a crowd full of screaming women ready for dancing men? LH: What goes into a script like this? All of me. Plus a hearty side of self-awareness. While writing, I had to keep in mind that I am the last thing ladies are expecting to see at Magic Mike Live. They bought tickets to see sweaty man abs, not this lady. Through the writing, I had to ingratiate myself to the women in such a way that they would champion my sexual liberation just as they would their very own.
TA: How would your mom explain your current job to her girlfriends? LH: This is a great question. She wouldn’t actually. At first both parents were very supportive because I was getting health insurance. Then slowly my Mom started asking questions. “Lyndsay, will you be putting this on the Facebook? I may need to unfriend you because some of the ladies in my coffee group might see.” 
Both parents have been to the show and LOVE it. My Mom even got “candyshopped.” You have to see the show to know what that means, but once you do, I want you to picture a very conservative 70-year-old woman from the south getting “shopped” while my father films it for his Instagram story. TA: Sounds like quite an experience! How would you describe the energy of the audience? LH: It’s like being in the mosh pit at a Pantera concert where the audience is wearing heels and sequins.  TA: How do you select who goes on stage?  LH: For me, I try to select audience volunteers with big smiles and great energy. Sometimes we are told phenomenal stories by the friends of a bride or servicewoman in attendance, and in that case, we do what we can to “give ‘em the food” as we say in the industry.
I can give you a secret show tip: Wear pants. You increase your chances of getting selected.

TA: The choreography of Magic Mike is one of the major differences from other male revues like Thunder Down Under and Chippendales. Who is behind it and what are some of the dance backgrounds of the guys? LH: Alison Faulk, Teresa Espinosa and Luke Broadlick are the choreographers for this show. Together they are known as “ATL.”  The guys in the show have danced for everyone from Madonna to Mariah Carey to Jennifer Lopez. Our Mike (Channing Tatum’s character in the movie), Ryan Carlson, has an extensive ballet background and toured with the Bad Boys of Dance.
TA: Without giving too much away, what would you say is going to make the audience blush the most? LH: While there is no full frontal–we are a dance revue, not a strip show–you can expect full buttal. I would say that the way the men are willing to make eye contact may be the moment your cheeks get red.
TA: What are these guys like shirt on or off? LH: They are all very sweet, incredible men with and without their clothes. These men are entrenched in their own wellness routines, and that makes them very self-assured in a great way. They all genuinely care about women.  TA: What are some secrets about the guys that would surprise the audience? LH: One of our gentlemen was so overcome with gratitude when his mom met Channing that he started bawling. It was one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen. Two of the men are loving and devoted fathers. That may break the facade for some audience members, but for me, that is the sexiest trait ever. 
TA: What is one of the funnier things someone has shouted at you or one of the guys? LH: The real answers aren’t for print, but there is a line in the show where I ask the Mike character what he really wants and nightly a woman will yell “me!” 
TA: What do you think is the best seat in the house? LH: My lap? Just kidding. I have heard that ladies get the most attention when they are one row back from the stage (wink). We perform in the round, so that would be any seat in the second row. There isn’t a bad seat in the house, though. The venue is insane!
TA: When you’re not hanging out with the Magic Mike guys, where do you go for fun or even to relax in Vegas?  LH: My bed. My bathtub. My refrigerator. Alone. Otherwise RYK Yoga and Meditation Center, Container Park, VegeNation and Red Rock Canyon.   
TA: What do you think makes Magic Mike different than any other shows in Vegas right now?  LH: Well firstly, the emcee is fire. Apparently, she was voted the “best emcee in Las Vegas” by Vegas Seven. 
But for real, Magic Mike Live is the hottness. It has the best choreography, the best abs, the best looking (and kindest) dude dancers, amazing music and it is all offered from an empowered female perspective. That is what it has over other shows. And the emcee.

"22","Experienced travelers—like these professional travel bloggers—reassure us that it’s easy to make friends in foreign lands. Naturally, you need to be open to talking to new people (yikes! ?), but it also helps to put yourself in situations where you’re likely to meet others with similar interests. Consider these recommendations, and get ready for new relationships to blossom.
Start by asking friends of yours to put you in touch with their friends living in the destination you’re travelling to, or reach out to the people you follow on social media who are living there to see if they want to meet with you for a meal. Once at your destination, be open-minded and social by interacting with people at your hotel, signing up to group activities and going to local pop-up events.
Join Facebook groups of expats and attend some of the meeting they organise. The easiest way though is to be curious and start a conversation with a stranger while having a meal in a local restaurant or in local transport.
Meeting friends with common interests is easy when you belong to organizations. I recommend connecting with chapters, meet-ups or other organizations before traveling for tips, insider information and making friends.
The very easiest way to make friends is to post on Facebook that you’re going to _________. Invariably someone you know is there or knows someone there, and you’ve got a dining buddy / tour guide / new friend before you know it. And you’ll meet their friends too.
Staying in hostels is a great way to meet people, but the best way to make friends while travelling is to be open, honest, kind and talkative. Basically – just go and speak to everyone!
Be open and settle in at the bar. Even as a luxury travel blogger, I constantly make friends. It helps that I spend a lot of time at the bar for my Best Sips podcast. There is always someone to talk to while sipping a cocktail!
Take a river cruise. The ships are small enough so that you can form deeper connections with other travelers onboard during meal times, at the bar, while touring and during general day-to-day activities.
To make friends while traveling, you can book a group tour doing something exciting. Things like zip-lining, jungle tours, even food tours can bond people together with camaraderie.  Of course, there is the nightlife, but booking tours is fun and easy.
TripAdvisor tip: From culinary Segway tours to exploring a city’s haunted spots at night, you can find tours for any interest and book them right on TripAdvisor.
One of the best ways to make friends while traveling is to join an organized activity like a walking tour.  I find that people are always willing to chat, and if you hit it off, you can easily transition into another outing like a meal or drinks when the tour is over.  Plus, you’ll already have one shared experience under your belt to bond over!
Group walking tours are another great way to meet people. Usually, the guide doesn’t talk the entire time giving you the opportunity to chat with others while you walk.
To make friends while travelling I like to do trips, excursions and fun activities. Not only does it get me out of my comfort zone but also creates ample opportunity to meet new people!
I love to do fitness activities while I’m traveling like a yoga class or finding a local running group.  It’s a great way to meet like-minded people!
The best way to meet new people is to participate in activities. Whether it’s simply going to the hotel bar on a busy night or taking a tour with a group, the number one thing you can do is get out of the hotel room!
Put yourself out there! Talk to and get to know the people around you. Whether it be another family at your dining table on a cruise ship or fellow travellers on a plane or train. Ask tips, discuss favourite sites and invite people to join you. Make a habit of talking with someone new in every place and see what develops.
Have fun! Do new things, activities you’ve always wanted to try, other people will be in the same boat! Do things which put a smile on your face, if people see you having fun they will want a piece of it too! Don’t be afraid to ask questions either, I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve asked for directions or for a recommendation from someone and ended up spending time with new people making new friends.
Making friends can be quite simple if you are prepared to engage in talking and communicating with your fellow travelers that you meet along the way. Listening to their experiences and sharing your travels is a good way to find a common way to engage. Be sensitive to the cultures of the people you meet and share emails and Facebook to continue the friendship developed whilst traveling.  
Part of the joy of traveling is meeting new people, especially locals from the area. I always put myself out there sitting at the bar area or shared tables. Talking to people at the breakfast bar and finding an open seat with a group of people. Or easy enough to do is to find an empty seat in any venue and ask if you can share that with someone, start up a conversation about why or what you are doing at that particular destination.
Be willing and open to chat with strangers. Be kind – it could be helping someone with their luggage overhead on the plane to help point someone in the right direction if they have no map or phone to help. The smallest of tasks could open you up to new friends.
There’s no taboo on talking to strangers! A deck of cards is also a great ice breaker!
Kids are the ultimate icebreaker! They have no boundaries or judgment and their openness means we find the locals welcoming us, and them, with open arms in a way that never happened when we were travelling solo.
TripAdvisor tip: We hear dogs are also great icebreakers ?."

Once a surfer mecca, Kuta has become a haven for backpackers and partiers who appreciate its beaches alongside the Indian Ocean. Traffic can be heavy here, so try to walk when you can. And while it’s possible to get massages throughout Bali, the spas in Kuta tend to be the most plentiful and competitively priced. Young Spa Bali, Smart Salon and Day Spa, and The Natural Massage and Day Spa all get rave reviews. For aspiring surfers, the beachfront town also offers plenty of opportunities to learn at places like Bali Learn to Surf, which is run out of the Hard Rock Hotel, and Bali Wave Hunter. It’s also a shopper’s paradise. The nine-acre Beachwalk Shopping Center houses a mix of stores, including Tommy Hilfiger and Yves Rocher, plus a cinema, restaurants, and even some greenery.
Where to Stay
	

	

Sanur, which is more serene than Kuta, appeals to mature travelers who enjoy beachfront beauty without the thumping beats. In addition to its excellent restaurants (Warung Little Bird and CharMing), the seaside town is prime spot for learning how to scuba dive and snorkel. Octopus, scorpion fish, and dramatic coral reefs can all be found in the water. Opt for a lesson from one of the dive schools like Atlantis International and Joe’s Gone Diving. Of course, there are also stunning stretches of sand, including Sanur and Sindhu beaches. To satisfy your culture fix, head to Museum Le Mayeur. Here, the collection was curated by a Belgian artist who lived in Bali and married Ni Pollok, a local dancer. As you’ll see, Pollok became the subject of much of his work. Paintings and drawings by other European artists can also be viewed.
Where to Stay
	

	

Legian, a small section of Bali that’s about as big as a handful of city blocks, has a reputation for reasonably priced hotels and easy access to the adventurous nightlife in nearby Kuta. Surf and boogie board fans will dig the combination of wallet-friendly accommodations and strong waves. And while there aren’t as many upscale spas in Legian, finding a beachside masseuse is easy. Tip: it’s best to negotiate and agree on a price for the treatment first. There are also a number of tasty food joints that serve a mix of Indonesian and Western cuisines. Cheap Thai food is also easy to come by. When it’s time to party, make your way to The Jaya Pub for live bands.
Where to Stay
	

	

Although part of Tabanan borders the water, the town is better known for its lush green hills and historic temples. Bali’s second tallest peak, the stratovolcano that goes by the name of Mount Batukaru, lies here. Pura Luhur Batukaru, a Hindu temple located on the slope of Mount Batukaru, is considered one of Bali’s most religious locations. A short distance away is Pura Bukit Sari, a temple that’s guarded by the macaques who inhabit the nearby forest. The Bali Butterfly Park, which is best visited during the morning when the insects are active, is another can’t miss. So is the Ogoh-Ogoh Museum, where Hindu monsters are recreated as giant effigies and put on display. And anyone who is still itching for some outdoor action can go tubing on a river or head south to Pererenan Beach.
Where to Stay
	

	

Located in central Bali, Ubud has some of the most impressive arts and crafts as well as historic sites on the island. The small yet entrancing Saraswati Temple features ponds filled with fishes and turtles and the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary is home to cute and clever primates that steal from careless tourists. Plus, religious structures like Goa Gajah (or Elephant Cave) and the Gunung Kawi temple complex were also developed in the nearby area.
There’s plenty of art to be enjoyed as well. The Agung Museum of Art showcases work by well-known Balinese artists as well as Europeans who emigrated to the island, including Rudolf Bonnet and Walter Spies. The Neka Art Museum has rooms dedicated to artists like Arie Smit and I Gusti Nyoman Lempad. Some consider the collection here to be the most important in Bali.
Where to Stay
	

	

While known as a somewhat staid gated community, Nusa Dua is also the location of Bali’s convention center and most popular golf course. Attractions here tend to be luxurious, expensive, and impressive. For example, Nusa Dua Beach is quite clean and dotted with upscale resorts, including a Westin and St. Regis. Nusa Dua is also known for its high-quality spas like Jari Menari Nusa Dua and Sekar Jagat Spa, so be prepared to be pampered from head to toe. Other must-see attractions include Museum Pasifika, which offers eclectic masterpieces from a variety of painters; Water Blow, a rock formation with a narrow opening that causes the water to explode when smashing against it; and the nearby Bali National Golf Club, which features creeks, tropical birds, and canyons.
Where to Stay
	

	

About 10 years ago, Seminyak was a low-key, fairly unremarkable town. Recent development, however, has turned it into a focal point for luxury spas and high-end boutiques. There’s no shortage of things to see and do here. Massages are pricey, but still cost about half of what they do in most European and American spas. Adventurous surfers will also appreciate the white sand and great waves at Seminyak Beach. And Pura Petitenget, a compact temple founded in the 16th century, is known for its beachside ceremonies. There are also several restaurants, bars, and clubs with panoramic views, including the Potato Head beach club, cliff-side Rock Bar, and Ku De Ta. For something the whole family will love, head to the 3D Trick Art Museum, which features murals of bank vaults and Venetian canals.

"24","JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai holds the record for the tallest hotel in the world. From the bottom to the top, it stands at 1,165 feet high in Dubai. It was designed by Ashok Korgaonkar, with the first tower opening in 2012. Today, the JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai is a sleek five-pearl property with a clean and modern design that attracts mostly business travelers and couples. It’ comprises two towers with 1,608 rooms, 14 dining options, a spa, and 8,000 square feet of meeting space between them. The outdoor pool has lovely views of other skyscrapers of Dubai.
Some could argue that the Park Hyatt Shanghai is the tallest hotel in the world, as the building’s topmost point sits at 1,614 feet in the air. However, that claim is a bit of a stretch, as the hotel is only housed on the 79th to 93rd floors of the Shanghai World Financial Center. Park Hyatt Shanghai is a fairly small hotel with only 179 rooms that overlook the Bund, the Huangpu River, and Pudong. The interiors are smart and go for a modern take on Chinese-style — note the tai chi courtyard where classes are held each day. A pool, spa, and a gym are other great perks here, but they can’t compete with the views from the on-site restaurants.
Rose Rayhann by Rotana Dubai was crowned the world’s second tallest hotel by the Guinness Book of World Records. With 72 stories and 462 suites and rooms, the upscale property sits at 1,093 feet high in Dubai, just a 12-minute drive away from JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai, the tallest hotel in the world. As a four-pearl hotel, the design is modern, though not quite luxurious. That’s not to say that it’s not impressive, especially in terms of amenities like a rooftop pool, seven meeting rooms, and diverse dining options.
The Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong boasts the highest bar in the world at 1,608 feet up — much higher than the top of the JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai. However, like the Park Hyatt Shanghai, The Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong only occupies the top 17 floors of the International Commerce Center in Hong Kong, making its “tallest” reputation a little hazy. Despite such technicalities, it’s hard not to be impressed with the views from the indoor pool, rooms, and restaurants — when it’s not cloudy, that is. Unfortunately, it’s a little out of the way, located in the business area of Tsim Sha Tsui, which doesn’t make it ideal for leisure travelers on vacation.
Baiyoke Sky Hotel is the tallest building in Thailand, and, subsequently, one of the tallest buildings in the world at 1,014 feet high. The hotel is far from upscale, but it’s quite affordable — an added perk for guests, as most of the tallest hotels in the world are quite pricey. If not staying at the hotel, there is a revolving observation deck on the 84th floor, though it costs a fee to enter unless you eat at the restaurant just below it. It’s definitely well-worth a visit to the Bangkok Balcony on the 81st floor — the country’s highest open-air restaurant with beautiful city views.
Waking up in the Four Seasons Hotel Guangzhou is a spectacular experience, thanks to curved floor-to-ceiling windows at the 1,439-foot-tall hotel in Guangzhou, China. The chic hotel is situated on the 74th through 98th floors of the Guangzhou IFC and is often visited by business travelers. Views of the Pearl River are especially dazzling from Catch, the seafood restaurant on the 100th floor. Just like its contemporaries on this list, the views are dependent on the day’s smog conditions.
With a contemporary design and basic amenities, the best thing that the 85 Sky Tower Hotel has going for it are the views. It sits at 1,240 feet high in Taiwan in the New Bay Area in Kaohsiung. The rooms are a bit plain in decor, but all come with bay views, some even from 70 stories high. The 74th floor is home to the View Deck, which allows for stunning Instagram-worthy pictures. However, take the opportunity to eat in the Chinese or Japanese restaurants on the 77th floor for a dining experience in the sky.
Corner rooms at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai are breathtaking, especially at night when the lights of Shanghai twinkle 1,380 feet below. During the day, some rooms overlook the Bund. Located on the 53rd to the 87th floors of the Jin Mao Tower, the Grand Hyatt Shanghai has a sophisticated design and a phenomenal central atrium. The bar Cloud 9 offers 360-degree panoramic views, while Club Jin Mao has skyline views. With a pool, gym, and many meeting spaces, it’s often visited by business travelers, though with a nearby metro stop, it’s not a bad place for vacationers either.
Standing at 753 feet high, the Residence Inn New York Manhattan/Central Park doesn’t seem so impressive when compared to the JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai. But in the United States, 753 feet high makes it very impressive, and, consequently, the tallest hotel in the country. It opened in 2013 and is just a five-minute walk from Central Park and a 10-minute walk from Times Square. The hotel features a stylish design and rooms with kitchenettes and floor-to-ceiling windows. Free breakfast buffets and free Wi-Fi are pretty fantastic amenities for a New York City hotel, too.
Dubai is home to many of the world’s tallest hotels, including Burj Al Arab. The hotel stands at 1,053 feet high and was designed to resemble a billowing Arabian Dhow sail. It may not be the tallest hotel in the world, but Burj Al Arab does have the tallest atrium in the world. The five-pearl property sits on a beachy private island and has great ocean views from rooms and the rooftop pool. Burj Al Arab offers an opulent stay with such decadent amenities like 24-karat-gold iPads in all the suites."
"25","Vietnam’s capital is a bustling city overflowing with motorbikes, museums and the east-meets-west-meets-French flair that makes the country so unique. Get the lay of the land with a private morning tour from Crossing Vietnam. A local expert will lead you through the One Pillar Pagoda Buddhist temple, the gardens and memorials of the Ho Chi Minh Complex and the Temple of Literature, Vietnam’s first university. Then it’s time to hit the lively and remarkably preserved Old Quarter, which has served as Hanoi’s major commercial district for more than a thousand years. If you need a break from all the hustle of Hanoi, consider joining Hanoi Urban Adventures’ half-day bike ride to the nearby countryside. You’ll feel Hanoi’s bustle melt away as you pedal past rural villages, banana plantations and vegetable farms before arriving in Quang Ba, with its floating houses and colorful flower fields.
Back in Hanoi, book a room at the La Beaute De Hanoi Hotel. Despite its central location in the Old Quarter, this hotel offers a surprisingly relaxing and quiet retreat.
“Location is terrific if you’re looking to explore the Old Quarter as everything is walkable,” says one traveler. “There are a ton of great food and drink options nearby as well.”
One of the most beautiful seascapes in the world, Halong Bay is a must-see for anyone visiting Vietnam for the first time. Here pillars of jungle-capped limestone rise from the Gulf of Tonkin to create a striking backdrop that the locals call “the bay of descending dragons”. Hop aboard one of Vietnam Open Day Tours’ day cruises for a relaxing ride through the bay’s lush islands and floating fishing villages. You’ll even get to hop off and explore Halong’s mysterious caves and inlets. Many travelers only spend a day enjoying this stunning shoreline before returning to their hotel in the city. Why not extend your visit and book a room at the Royal Lotus Hotel?
“The service, the rooms, the rooftop bar and the food were out of this world!” says one traveler.
Or consider spending the night in a traditional wooden junk boat (it’s way nicer than it sounds) with Buffalo Tours. Set your alarm for an early morning dip or tai chi class, or simply to enjoy a cup of Vietnamese coffee while watching dawn break over the bay.
Traditional Vietnamese cuisine is world-renowned for its use of fresh ingredients, like lemongrass, mint and coriander, and its spicy and tangy glazes made from fish sauce and shrimp paste. It’s often considered one of the healthiest cuisines in the world thanks to its minimal reliance on dairy and oil and its heavy use of vegetables and herbs. To learn more about what makes Vietnamese food so unique, join Charming Vietnam Travel on a walking tour of Vietnam’s Old Quarter. You’ll sample local fruits from the district’s food vendors, and taste local delicacies like Bún Chả, a grilled pork and noodle dish, and Banh Cuon, a rice noodle roll.
Hanoi Urban Adventures also offers a walking tour of Vietnam’s best street foods. Spend the day exploring the barbecue stands that line the labyrinth of lanes in the Old Quarter while getting behind the scenes access at some of the district’s most popular eateries. Then slip into a local’s only cafe near Hoan Kiem Lake where you can sip on egg coffee while enjoying the view. Want an even more in-depth look at the local cuisine? Consider a Vietnamese cooking class. You’ll get to shop the markets with a local chef before trying your hand at making Vietnamese street food, barbecue, salads and more.
This UNESCO-listed waterfront city is famous for its remarkably preserved Ancient Town, lively canals and unique mix of Chinese, Japanese and French architecture. Learn more about the history of the region on a small group tour that includes a stop at the My Son Sanctuary, a collection of 13th-century Hindu temples  in nearby Duy Xuyen. Here you’ll learn about the Champa Kingdom that controlled this area for centuries while exploring the 20 or so structures that remain from their rule. After a tasty and authentic Vietnamese lunch, you’ll hit the streets of Hoi An for a walking tour of what was once one of Southeast Asia’s most important trading posts. You’ll see the historic wooden houses where the city’s merchants lived, as well as the lively markets where they still sell their wares. For dinner, join a motorbike tour of the city’s best restaurants. You’ll taste local dishes like Cao Lau, a mix of noodles, pork and local greens, and Banh Beo rice snacks.
The Maison Vy Hotel is one of our travelers’ favorite places to stay in Hoi An. “We stayed a week for our holiday and were impressed from start to finish,” says one traveler. “The whole experience was flawless.”
The Mekong Delta is Vietnam’s agricultural headquarters. To learn how the country’s food system functions, take a tour of the delta in a traditional sampan boat. You’ll travel the city’s crisscrossing canals while learning about the region’s impressive history and experiencing the unique life of those who live in this aquatic agricultural region. Hungry? Learn about the culinary traditions of the Mekong by taking a cooking class that includes a visit to the city’s floating markets.
After marveling over boats full of exotic fruits, you’ll learn how to make local delicacies like fried elephant-ear fish. The waterside Island Lodge, with its expansive pool and charming gardens, is a relaxing retreat after a day of eating and exploring."
"26","The Eastern European country of Croatia fills in for many of the key fictional destinations in the show, including the capital city of the Seven Kingdoms, King’s Landing, home of the Iron Throne. Brush up on your trivia and get the lowdown on the complex histories of the Baratheons, the Starks, and the Targaryens from your expert tour guide. You can even take in the city by sea (without the threat of glowing, green wildfire) on a Game of Thrones cruise and walking tour.
Bolstering your “Thrones” knowledge while exploring the beautiful and historic Old Town of Dubrovnik? That’s called killing two Three-Eyed Ravens with one stone. Lovrijenac Fortress, which served as the Red Keep, and Trsteno Arboretum, home to the King’s Landing palace gardens, are just a few of the other destinations visited on “GoT” tours in Dubrovnik.
Looking to explore beyond the walls of King’s Landing? Travel across the Narrow Sea (or just north of Dubrovnik) to tour the locations that stood in on camera for the city of Meereen. Explore historic Klis Fortress, where Daenerys launched her attack against The Great Masters, and a 3rd century Roman palace where the slaves of Meereen plotted their uprising.
The Island of Malta’s historical sites served as set-pieces for many dramatic Game of Thrones scenes in the first two seasons of the series. Refresh yourself on those early episodes as you tour Mdina and Rabat, guided by two actors who appeared in the show. Explore filming locations for King’s Landing and the infamous Red Keep, all the while hearing the behind-the-scenes gossip from the show’s time in Malta.
The sometimes severe but always magnificent natural panoramas of Iceland serve as the perfect backdrop for the show. Specifically, the Lake Myvatn area has become one of the most popular “GoT” film locations. The lake became the location known as north of the Wall where the Free Folk, or wildlings, call home and where the fearsome White Walkers roam.
From the (very real) city of Reykjavik, you can spend an entire day on a guided tour of featured film locations such as the UNESCO-listed Thingvellir National Park, which was used as the path to Eyrie. As an added travel bonus, you can visit Iceland’s largest geothermal power stations at Nesjavellir and Lake Thingvallavatn in southwestern Iceland.
Northern Ireland has provided the location scouts of “GoT” ample opportunity for truly memorable moments – the Red Woman’s shadow baby episode, anyone? Fans can take a full-day tour from Belfast and get the latest gossip, visit iconic filming locations such as the caves where young Bran Stark hides out. You’ll make a stop at the UNESCO-listed Giant’s Causeway, one of Northern Ireland’s most popular natural wonders, and the famed Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. Also included on the tour is one of Northern Ireland’s most photographed destinations: the Dark Hedges, also known as the Kingsroad in Thrones-speak.
And what trip would be complete without a tour of Winterfell? Explore Castle Ward, used to film scenes in the northern castle, led by a guide who has appeared in the series. See where the Starks discovered their Direwolf pups in Tollymore Forest Park, and visit the Inch Abbey, where the “Young Wolf” Robb Stark was crowned King in the North.
We’ve already mentioned the Dark Hedges, but fans and the curious alike should take advantage of this fan-favorite tour that leaves from Ireland’s capital city of Dublin and then heads into Northern Ireland. Travelers can discover additional sites made famous by the show, including the Caves of Cushendun, Ballintoy Harbour, and Larrybane Quarry.
The plotline of season five introduced the kingdom of Dorne. It’s been said that the look and feel of Dorne, the southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms, was heavily influenced by medieval Spain. The country made its debut in 2015 and has appeared on the show ever since.
You can follow in the footsteps of the Lannisters and the Targaryens on an 8-hour tour to gorgeous Girona from the capital city of Barcelona. The historic medieval architecture of Girona doubles as the free city of Braavos and as parts of King’s Landing, so it’s quite easy to get into the “Thrones” spirit as you explore the city’s winding streets. Be sure to take advantage of the many shops, restaurants and ancient stone staircases dotting the Jewish Quarter and Old Town.
The southern city of Spain famous for flamenco dancing, Seville, is now also known for providing several key “GoT” backdrops. The UNESCO-listed Alcázar of Seville served as both the location of House Martell and the Martell family’s adjoining private retreat – the lush Water Gardens of Dorne. A guided tour in Seville will have you feeling like the Protector of the Realm in no time. You’ll check out the fighting pits of Danzak, walk through the same courtyards as Prince Oberyn Martell and if you opt for the full-day tour, prepare yourself for a full-on Thrones-themed feast.
Even if you’re not fully invested in the world of Westeros, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy what each of these unique cities has to offer. But if you’re like millions of others around the world tuning in to see who’s closer at winning the Game of Thrones? Well, then we hope this list gives you the destination inspiration you need to check out the Seven Kingdoms and more, in person!

"27","According to a new TripAdvisor report on the best time to book hotels for summer savings, there are several top destinations where you can save up to 23% on hotels by booking within a few months of your stay.
Take a closer look at five of them below, then find your ideal hotel on TripAdvisor, where we check up to 200 sites for today’s lowest hotel prices.
Many travelers head to Chicago in summer: The weather is warm (temps average 73-79°F or 23.9-27.2°C), skies are generally sunny and outdoor activities abound. Don’t skip the Magnificent Mile, a lively and walkable 13-block stretch of North Michigan Avenue lined with hundreds of shops and restaurants – and, of course, plenty of hotels.
Speaking of hotels, our report found that you can save up to 18% on Chicago hotels this summer if you book within two months of your stay. That means savings on hotels like Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile, an architecturally stunning 32-floor hotel with spacious rooms and suites, or the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, a historic club turned boutique hotel with a well-equipped game room and other fun touches.
Once you’re settled in, book a bike tour on TripAdvisor to see even more of the city. This popular tour lets you pedal through different neighborhoods sampling pizza, hot dogs and more (while burning calories along the way!). Only have a couple of days? Check out our complete guide to making the most of a short visit.
Summer in the Northern Hemisphere is winter in Cape Town, with temperatures averaging 45-64°F (8-18°C) bringing relief from summer heat. Grab a jacket and head there in June, July or August for seasonal savings – you’ll save up to 18% on hotels if you book within four months, and the average summer rate is just $106/night.
If you’re a fan of small, unique hotels, try MannaBay, a Travelers’ Choice award winner in the heart of Cape Town. Pick one of its eight themed suites, explore nearby Table Mountain National Park and don’t forget to stay for high tea.
While you’re there, book this top-rated Cultural Cape Town Tour on TripAdvisor to get a sense of the city’s diversity and history. You’ll see brightly-colored houses and Cape Malay architecture in Bo-Kaap, then learn about Xhosa culture in Langa, the city’s oldest and largest township. It’s an experience you’ll find nowhere else.
Heading to the City of Light this summer? Our report found that you can save up to 23% on Paris hotels if you book within two months of your trip – and that summer hotel rates average $188/night.
For the best deals, try top-rated value hotels like Hotel Joke – Astotel. TripAdvisor travelers praise its comfy rooms, quirky décor and location close to the Metro and the Moulin Rouge. If you want to pamper yourself, Parisian style, La Reserve Paris Hotel and Spa has everything you could wish for, from personal butler service to an elegant indoor pool.
Paris sees its warmest weather in June, July and August, with temps averaging 61-68°F (16-20°C). To stay cool, book an air-conditioned Seine river cruise on TripAdvisor. And remember: Don’t get tickets for attractions and shows the day you plan to go. To save time and avoid long lines, buy them online in advance. (Get more tips on what NOT to do in Paris here.)
It’s not surprising that TripAdvisor travelers chose Sydney as Australia’s #1 destination of 2017. Think Sydney Opera House, the Circular Quay, incredible beaches and a bustling Central Business District with easy access to it all.
If you’re heading to Sydney this summer, keep two things in mind. First, you’ll save up to 11% on hotels if you book within three months of your trip, with hotel rates averaging $137/night. Second, June, July and August are winter in Australia, though you don’t need to worry about extreme cold; temperatures average 47.8-62.6°F or 8.8-17°C.
So where should you stay while you’re there? Try the Primus Hotel Sydney, a renovated Art Deco hotspot in the heart of the aforementioned Central Business District, or The Meriton Serviced Apartments World Tower, featuring suites with floor-to-ceiling windows in the city’s highest residential building. For more ideas, check out these hotels for all budgets in Sydney’s coolest neighborhoods.
Hong Kong is famous for its delectable dim sum, floating islands and one-of-a-kind skyline.
Summer here is monsoon season, with hot, humid weather (averaging 86-90°F or 26-27°) and occasional heavy rain. The good news? It’s also “discount season,” and travelers willing to pack an umbrella can find some incredible deals.
If you travel in June, July or August, you’ll save up to 23% on Hong Kong hotels compared to peak rates, especially if you book within five months of your trip. That means big potential savings on some of Hong Kong’s best hotels, like the Travelers’ Choice award-winning Hotel ICON, an architecturally striking hotel with a unique vertical garden.
To cool off on hot days, catch sea breezes at Repulse Bay, a popular beach with a family-friendly boardwalk. Or book a Cheung Chau Island tour on TripAdvisor – you’ll get to see 3,000 year-old-rock carvings and timeless fishing villages, followed by (of course) a dim sum lunch."
"28","A castle hotel might trigger fantasies of lavish chandeliers and ornate tapestries, but this medieval Tuscan property swaps opulence for an inviting, intimate stay. The family-run bed-and-breakfast, which is a short drive (or 45-minute walk) from Siena, houses only three guest rooms, including an apartment and two-story tower room with a spiral staircase. There’s not much to do here in the way of activities, but that just gives you more time to admire the Italian countryside setting.
Situated in a restored stone castle built in the 15th century among rolling hills of the Tuscan countryside, this 15-room hotel has hosted guests like Leonardo da Vinci and poet Francesco Redi. Our guess is that they were in it for the scenic views. And with an outdoor infinity pool overlooking the countryside, gorgeous gardens with front-row seats to the hills, and rooms (some with balconies) that look out onto the courtyard and green landscape, there are plenty of spots to take in the scenery. Better still? The setting only looks more idyllic after a few glasses of vino. Conveniently, the property still produces wine on site (guests can tour the working wine cellar and taste-test the vinos).
This restored 14th-century castle, which was originally created as a fortress by the Bevilacqua family, is designed to impress visitors before they even arrive at the main entrance. Guests enter through a long drive that’s flanked with pine trees, and pass through an enclosed passageway first. Once on the grounds, this romantic vibe only continues. Outside, manicured lawns surround the castle, and a vine-encased gazebo adds to the property’s elegance. Inside, the reception area is outfitted with a beautiful glass chandelier and heavy tasseled curtains; the hallway is dressed in old mahogany furniture, large oil paintings, and a gargantuan Chinese vase; and the elevator is regal with marble siding and a gold-framed mirror. There’s also an on-site rustic wine cellar with tastings. Even the rooms are styled with antique furniture and museum-worthy artwork (though amenities are modern). And just in case you’re looking for a change of scenery during your stay (you won’t), Vicenza and Verona are an easy drive away.
Before this 74-room property was making honeymooners’ dreams come true, it was an 11th-century monastery, and later a castle and residence for a noble family. And while isolated it may be (it’s the centerpiece of the surrounding vineyards and lush Tuscan countryside), there are still plenty of activities to keep guests occupied, including a full-service spa that offers facials, massages, and body treatments; two outdoor pools; a large fitness center; and a gourmet restaurant owned by Gordon Ramsay.
Vacationers looking for a retreat with preserved medieval character should book it to this 13th-century castle, located on a hill just outside Perugia. The façade has been maintained, as have the interior details, including wooden staircases, bits of ceiling frescoes, and more. Spend some time inside the castle walls — the spectacular bar with stained glass windows, on-site restaurant serving local fare, and steam room and sauna should keep you happy. But make sure to get outside, too. There’s an outdoor pool with views of the Umbrian countryside, well-maintained gardens for strolling, and an accessible rooftop with 360-degree views of the bucolic landscape.
Formerly a farmers village that was born around the medieval Banfi Castle, Castello Banfi – Il Borgo has been restored and transformed into a luxury resort. It’s home to high-quality red wines (vineyards surround the area and vinos like Brunello and other Super Tuscans are produced here). The hotel also offers free wines in the guest rooms and tastings in the wine shop. But you don’t have to be a wine enthusiast to enjoy your stay. Visitors also come for the chic pool with a view of the vineyards, two restaurants, glass museum, and charming ambiance (picture stone and brick pathways, cyprus trees, terra-cotta flower pots, ivy crawling over stone walls, and a charming rose garden).
Nestled in the pastoral Umbrian countryside, this 23-room hotel takes up shelter in a 14th-century stone manor. The olive trees, orchards, gardens, lake, and spa and sauna on the grounds surely make for a tranquil getaway, but those looking for something a little more action-packed won’t have to look too far. The property also offers tennis, bocce, mountain biking, horseback riding, and an outdoor freeform pool with views of the verdant Umbrian valley.
t’s not hard to see why Castello di Petroia lures couples looking for a romantic, removed getaway. Set on a lush 800-acre estate, the hilltop castle dates back to the 11th century. And while it was first restored in the 1980s, it still manages to hold onto much of its medieval charm (each of the 13 rooms have historic touches, including stone arches, wood beams, and frescoed ceilings). Only adding to the serene vibe are footpaths, olive groves, and a seasonal outdoor pool.

"29","We know that you use TripAdvisor to help make informed travel decisions before you travel, so recently we launched a new notification to alert travelers when there is a possible serious and persistent health, safety or discrimination issue at a business that is getting significant media attention and that is not necessarily apparent in TripAdvisor reviews.
About a month ago, we added this notification for the first time to the business listing pages of a few properties. When deciding to add the notification we look at a number of factors, including whether or not the news reports are by credible media. We review each situation on a case-by-case basis and have stated that the notification can remain posted for up to 3 months. As more information becomes available about each case, we may decide to keep the badge up longer than 3 months, or take it down sooner. If, for example, the business is able to demonstrate that the reported safety concern has been addressed and is no longer an existing issue for travelers, then that information is taken into account when determining how long a business listing will continue to display the notification.
Today, TripAdvisor has made the decision to remove a notification from the business page of the Grand Velas hotel, in the Mexico Riviera Maya, regarding recent media about a health and safety issue experienced by a traveler.
In this case, the Grand Velas in Riviera Maya submitted an affidavit to TripAdvisor demonstrating that it has taken actions to address the health and safety matters reported in the media coverage, specifically with respect to its staff. For example, the staff member accused of the misconduct no longer works at the property and the property has changed its hiring practices. TripAdvisor is unaware of any information to suggest that the reported incident was systemic or pervasive at this resort. Furthermore, a review from the traveler who says he experienced an assault is present for our users to read on the Grand Velas TripAdvisor page.
This new information warrants removal of the notification at this time.
While the notification is no longer on the property, we continue to encourage travelers to use all available resources online to research a business’ health and safety record before making a travel decision.
It’s important to note that each decision about whether to add a notification to a business – as well as the decision to take down or leave up the notification – is made on a case-by-case basis. Every situation is different, though we will apply our guidelines and principles to evaluate each one, including:
This is the first version of our traveler notification, and we will continue to evolve the policy and process for how we will implement these business alerts concerning health, safety and discrimination issues over the next several months and in years to come. As we continue to evaluate and refine our process, our intention is to seek feedback from our community of travelers and businesses to improve how we share important information on these important issues.
We want you and all travelers to be able to post reviews about your firsthand experiences on our site, especially if you have a health, safety or discrimination issue you want to share with the community. In fact, there are thousands of firsthand experiences concerning these issues written about in posts currently live on our site in reviews and forum content.
Just like many sites that host user-generated content, we have policies in place to ensure the integrity of the reviews we collect. Those guidelines are published on our site at https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/hc/en-us/articles/200614797-Our-guidelines-for-traveler-reviews and we employ a team of hundreds of content specialists who work tirelessly to apply our guidelines consistently and fairly.
While have never removed reviews or posts because we’re concerned that they might upset a business partner, there are times when we will decline reviews for publication if they don’t adhere to our published guidelines for user-submitted content. However, TripAdvisor is taking steps to make it more clear to you, our community, how to better understand what does and does not comply with our guidelines. For example, because reviews that include second-hand information are rejected, according to our guidelines, we have amended the communications we send to anyone whose reviews are rejected for this reason. These communications have previously caused some confusion due to their lack of specificity, so we’ve made changes in order to make them more detailed and user-friendly. Our new emails will clearly identify the phrase or sentences that don’t meet the policy guidelines, and invite the reviewer to revise and resubmit their review. This should help to ensure that more travelers are able to share their experiences on our site.
Ultimately, we continue to believe the best check-and-balance on the tourism industry is our community of hundreds of millions of global travelers."
"30","Venturing out to enjoy the colors of autumn can be invigorating. Whether you’re roaming the rural roads around your hometown or taking a tour of New England to see nature’s colorful fall foliage at its finest, the principles of photographing those images remain the same.
Here are some fall photography tips and tricks you can apply to take your best fall foliage pictures no matter where you are—from the mountains and streams to the city streets, wooded parks, and everywhere in between.
The instrument you use to capture pictures is your choice. Sometimes, the best camera is the one that’s with you—as the popular adage states—so grab your smartphone, a point-and-shoot, a DSLR, or whatever you prefer to shoot with, and let’s get to it.

This might be the most common kind of autumn foliage shot you can take, but beauty knows no bounds this time of year, so be sure to set your eyes to those distant hills, valleys, and mountains for a colorful collection of trees. Scenic overlooks are a good place to start, and any place you can get a wide-open view can likely provide some outstanding images. To make your landscape photography more interesting, try shooting from different heights and use the foreground (when applicable) to create depth in your image. Also, try shooting with the early morning or late-day sun rays—also known as the golden hour—for the best lighting of the day.

Rather than shooting all your pictures from eye level, explore some unique angles to provide a whole new perspective on your foliage photography.
If you happen to catch the leaves at their peak, you’ll see trees bursting with autumn colors. Warm tones such as red, yellow, orange, brown, and green abound this time of year.
It’s inevitable. The leaves on the trees change color, and then they fall off. That leaves (pun intended) a pile or trail of them for you to capture from a variety of angles. Sometimes they’re strewn about in haphazard fashion. Maybe you’ll see one all by itself on the forest floor. That’s OK, too. For each of these situations, there’s an image waiting to be captured.
Depending on where you are, it usually isn’t difficult to find colorful trees this time of year. There are photo opportunities everywhere. To make a particularly effective photo, look for rows of brightly decorated trees and try to fit as many of them as you can into your frame. Another idea is to take a bunch of fallen leaves and line them up in a row or pattern that appeals to you.
Don’t feel like you need to have a lot going on to make an interesting image, though. In fact, the simplicity of a single tree decorated with bright leaves can make for a powerful image.

Autumn isn’t only about colorful leaves. While it’s impossible to ignore the brilliant colors that emerge from trees of all shapes and sizes, there are other signs of the season to look for, too.
A roadside market might include baskets of apples, Jack-Be-Little pumpkins, gourds, flint corn, a wagon of large pumpkins, or pots of fall flowers. All these items are fair fodder on any autumn photography excursion, so try to seek them out during your travels.

Have you ever taken the time to really look at a leaf up close? You’ll find a fascinating array of colors and veins. Use a macro lens or app on your camera to magnify the leaf, thus providing an incredibly unique, close-up view. The details can be stunning.

If you’re near any body of water—whether it be a lake, river, pond, stream, ocean, or even a puddle—look for seasonal reflections on the surface, such as colorful, neighboring trees or fallen leaves floating along the water.
For a really creative spin, get your hands on a crystal ball and use it as a lens. Hold it in one hand or set it on the ground or other flat surface so it won’t roll away. When you look into it, you’ll see a refracted version of your subject. You’ll need to experiment with different angles as well as your distance from the crystal ball, but the results just might make your whole trip. Also consider using other items that cause a reflection, such as a window or mirrored sunglasses, to gain an interesting effect on your image.

If you concentrate on taking great pictures, you won’t need to do much editing (aka post-processing) when you’re finished. But it can be a fun and artistic way of enhancing any image you take. Whether you’re using Photoshop, Lightroom, or any smartphone photo editing app, you can make those fall colors “pop” even more with the right filter or adjustment, or you can create an abstract or painting of your image. The possibilities are endless.
Wherever your fall travels take you, bring your favorite camera and get ready to capture the sights of the season. You’ll have moments you can share with friends and family and memories that will last a lifetime.

"34","But Kerouac’s saga and love letter to the American road defined the mid-century literary movement known as the Beat Generation and helped elevate the iconic status of Americans’ love for their cars, kitschy motels, and trippy jazz. With that in mind, we thought it would be fun to celebrate the 60th anniversary of this great American road trip novel’s publication with a few handy tips and things you should be sure to notice while taking your own great American road trip, Kerouac style. 
Ready? Have a pen and notebook handy? Gassed up your jalopy? Let’s go.
Remember what Dean said about people spending all their time on the road worrying about getting to their destination? Itineraries are hip and handy, of course, but sometimes it’s okay to be daring and toss them out the window. Go with the flow and experience the ultimate freedom and adventure that only the open road can offer—planned or unplanned. Every moment of the journey (see this for some actual routes traveled in “On The Road”) is meant to be savored. Even a simple meatloaf sandwich at a back-road diner can be turned into a great story to share later. As you trek across North America, don’t be afraid to take detours and take chances. And if you feel intimidated about just venturing out on Route 66 with no road map at all, take advantage of experiences already researched by veteran travelers. They can always be modified mid-journey.
Kerouac did say, “All he needed was a wheel in the hand and four on the road.” We get that. But what Sal and his pals didn’t have was a score worthy of their madness. Just imagine the possibilities. Try Chuck Berry’s “Route 66,” “Lover Man” by Billie Holiday, and for irony, throw in 10,000 Maniacs’ “Hey Jack Kerouac” just to start. There’s always Spotify and Pandora to stream, but what about going old-school with the road tunes? 
Consider burning a CD (the next best thing to a mix tape) of pure jazz (think Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Ella Fitzgerald) for the ultimate Kerouacian effect to go along with your favorite jams. Even better, book a Big Apple jazz tour and start off a journey from New York City to San Francisco with a Kerouac vibe. Stopping through New Orleans, Nashville, or Memphis while dipping down south? Get in the groove with a visit to Jazz Fest, a backstage pass to the Grand Ole Opry, or a trip to Graceland. And if Cleveland happens to be anywhere on your road trip map, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a must.
Perhaps once upon a time, running out of gas on a stretch of isolated but photogenic highway would’ve meant a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for adventure, but in today’s travel world, we definitely know better. Don’t make the same mistakes made by Kerouac’s cast of characters. Aside from Google, mobile apps such as GasBuddy, Waze, and iExitcan tell you where to find the nearest gas station, national park (how about Arizona’s Grand Canyon?), or motel (fine if it’s really a hotel, but in the spirit of Kerouac and friends, we’ll stick with the whole drive-up motor-hotel theme). And if you’re looking for user reviews for any of the above, you can’t beat the TripAdvisor app.

Use your wits just like Dean and Sal, but don’t be afraid to ask for expert guidance from the locals (and from fellow road trippers). While you’re enjoying your crawfish gumbo and cup of Maxwell House black down in Louisiana (where you should check out a swamp tour), ask the waiter to tell you what the biggest secret is about the town you’ve landed in. Where does he go for an ice cream sundae? Better yet, where’s the best sunset view in town? What do you absolutely need to see when passing through Mississippi? Go beyond the guidebooks and don’t hesitate to ask for an insider recommendation.
“There was nowhere to go but everywhere.” Everywhere is overwhelming, man. That’s why, ultimately, you do need some kind of a road plan. Nothing fancy or too strict, of course. But maybe a little famous. We’ve already mentioned Route 66, which runs from Illinois to California and is world renowned for a reason (see these stops). Equally iconic are the Blue Ridge Parkway from Virginia to North Carolina, the Great River Road along the mighty Mississippi from Minnesota to Louisiana, and the Highway 12 Scenic Byway tracking through Utah. And once you get to Kerouac’s favorite United States destination, California, you’re treated to one of the most beautiful scenic drives in the country: the Pacific Coast Highway (where you can ditch the beatnik thing for a bit and see how the other half lives).
Regardless of where this journey leads or what you end up doing, remember to congratulate yourself. You’re on the open road. You’re free. Kerouac would be proud.

"35","Set the tone for the whole day with a cappuccino on the rooftop terrace of one of the city’s most romantic hotels. The Inn at the Roman Forum, tucked away on a quiet street near the Colosseum, features a cozy, vine-covered terrace, while the rooftop garden at Grand Hotel de la Minerve offers outdoor dining and sweeping views just steps from the Pantheon. At the Condotti Hotel by the Spanish Steps, you can book a room with a private outdoor terrace overlooking the rooftops of Rome.
Date day begins with a walk around Rome’s famous attractions, including the Trevi Fountain, which, though touristy, is a perfect spot to steal a kiss, a la Roman Holiday or The Lizzie McGuire Movie. Nearby Piazza Navona, full of baroque art and architecture, serves as a lovely background to continue the stroll and pass by its famous Fountain of Four Rivers (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi), sculpted by Bernini in the 17th century. Next, head over to the Colosseum and Roman Forum, or stop by the morning market at Campo de’ Fiori for fresh prosciutto, cheese, and flowers for your sweetheart. Consider a 4-hour food and wine tour to see all of the above with ease.
For pranzo (lunch), grab pizza al taglio (pizza by the slice) on a guided pizza walking tour, or order the pizza bianca from Campo de Fiori’s Antico Forno Roscioli for a slice of freshly baked white bread pizza drizzled in olive oil that you won’t soon forget. After, experience Rome as the locals do. The Verano Cemetery (Cimitero Monumentale del Verano) might not make it onto most 24-hour itineraries in Rome, but its beautiful architecture, sprawling grounds, and serenity render it a unique and intimate destination for a picnic. You two will feel as if you have the city to yourselves while relaxing on the park benches that line the historic gravel pathways.
Explore the Quartiere Coppedè area, northeast of Rome’s Centro Storico between Piazza Buenos Aires and via Tagliamento. This neighborhood was designed as an elaborate fantasyland by 20th-century architect Gino Coppedè and is virtually undiscovered by most tourists. So enjoy the peace and quiet of this district and its art nouveau, medieval, baroque, and ancient Greek architectural styles. Don’t miss the Fountain of the Frogs (Fontana delle Rane) at its center for yet another truly romantic scene.
The last few hours of daylight makes for a particularly popular time for couples to enjoy the central and expansive Villa Borghese (book a skip-the-line walking tour to treat your partner). There’s nature, art, and a small, idyllic lake, where you can rent boats and row your significant other around a faux-Greek temple anytime from 9am to nightfall. When the sun sets, head to the adjacent Monte Pincio terrace for stunning views over Piazza del Popolo and St. Peter’s Basilica. Other sunset scenes include the panoramic views at Gianicolo Hill, west of the Tiber River, and the 360-degree marvel from the Terrace of the Quadrigas (Terrazza delle Quadrighe) of the white marble Victor Emmanuel II Monument (Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II) in Piazza Venezia.
Move into date night with traditional Roman fare like pasta al cacio e pepe, a creamy noodle plate with cheese and pepper, or a crispy, thin-crust pizza ai pepperoni, which actually features roasted red bell peppers as a topping rather than meat. While there are a mix of restaurants in the city’s touristic center, you can still find high-quality eats right by main attractions, such as those at Taverna del Seminario, a trattoria-style restaurant serving up bistecca (steak) and pasta all’amatriciana (pasta with tomato sauce and pancetta) just steps away from the Pantheon. And of course, it’s always great to maximize your exploring and eating experience — consider booking a Rome by night walking tour with a multicourse dinner.
Nothing says “that’s amore” like a leisurely evening passeggiata (stroll) or Segway tour by the illuminated sights of Rome. The second-century Castel Sant’Angelo, one of the oldest monuments of the city, can be seen from the riverside walkway of Lungotevere, and from its bridge, which is surrounded by Bernini sculptures and the lights of the castle. The enchanting atmosphere is doubled at the nearby Milvio Bridge (Ponte Milvio), a famous location for young couples to express their love for one another by locking a padlock to the bridge and throwing the key into the water. Afterwards, take a stroll over to one of the nearby bars and seal the deal with a romantic cocktail (or two). If you’re still out around 2am, visit the top of the Spanish Steps, and you’ll get one of the world’s most popular attractions all to yourself.

"36","Where you’ll find it: In the Eiffel Tower (!)
Why eat there: According to the restaurant’s website, legendary chef Alain Ducasse dreamed of opening a restaurant inside Paris’ most famous landmark. His dream was realized with Le Jules Verne, which earned a Michelin star for its outstanding contemporary French food – and the admiration of visitors for its elegant atmosphere and unparalleled city views.
What travelers say: “The value is not just in the meal but also the ambiance and not waiting in lines. With your reservation you skip the long lines and go straight to the tower elevator where you give your reservation and they take you right to your table. After your meal you can take photos and take the elevator to the other observation decks for photos. So worth it! The food was very good also.” – TripAdvisor traveler marthaschirippa
Where to stay nearby: Go all out at the luxe Shangri-La Hotel Paris, where you can contemplate the Eiffel Tower from both your room and the hotel’s exquisite garden. It’s a splurge, but you’ll always find today’s lowest prices from up to 200 sites on TripAdvisor. For travelers on a budget, the conveniently-located Hotel Duquesne Eiffel also offers great views and some excellent deals.
Where you’ll find it: On (under?) Ragnali Island in the Maldives
Why eat there: Because you don’t get many chances to enjoy a gourmet meal underwater. At 16 feet below the ocean’s surface, Ithaa’s transparent walls and ceilings give you a front-row seat for all kinds of marine life swimming peacefully overhead. Its seven tables fill up fast, so make a reservation ahead of time.
What travelers say: “After seeing Ithaa on tons of travel lists, we planned our trip to the Maldives largely because of it. … Our server was top notch, the food was delicious, and the show of fish, huge mantas and reef sharks swimming overhead did not disappoint. We highly recommend this experience to everyone we talk to.” – TripAdvisor traveler TripcorAlly
Where to stay nearby: Ithaa is one of 12 restaurants at the Conrad Maldives Ragnali Island resort, a top-rated escape with white-sand beaches and secluded overwater villas. Head to TripAdvisor to read the latest reviews and get today’s lowest prices.
Where you’ll find it: At 7,700 feet above sea level, on top of Kicking Horse Mountain in British Columbia, Canada
Why eat there: Calling itself “Canada’s most elevated dining experience,” the Eagle’s Eye serves excellent food (travelers recommend the truffle fries) with an impeccable wine and beer selection. Best of all, the floor-to-ceiling windows and seasonal open-air patio offer panoramic views of three different mountain ranges and five national parks. Diners can unwind after skiing or hiking nearby, or be whisked up the mountain via gondola.
What travelers say: “It doesn’t look like much from outside, but inside is another story! The decor is mountain lodge, but the high ceilings, freestanding stone fireplace, and chandeliers make the building a standout. The view cannot be rivaled. We had excellent fresh salads (which I thought might be hard to pull off, given the transportation difficulties), and the service could not have been more pleasant, prompt or helpful.” – TripAdvisor traveler Laura M
Where to stay nearby: At the Aspens at Kicking Horse Mountain Resort you can reserve a ski-in, ski-out townhouse (with hot tub!) for a private and cozy high-altitude retreat. Get the lowest prices from up to 200 sites on TripAdvisor.
Where you’ll find it: Perched on yes, a rock, in the Indian Ocean
Why eat there: It doesn’t get any more secluded than this. Look for The Rock restaurant off the coast of Pingwe, in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and reach it either by boat or by walking through the waves at low tide. With only 14 tables, you’ll need to make a reservation in advance, but you definitely won’t feel crowded. What’s on the menu? Seafood, of course – TripAdvisor travelers recommend the lobster.
What travelers say: “My wife and I booked a table at The Rock whilst on our honeymoon and it was one of the best dining experiences we’ve had! It appears just like you see it in the pictures – beautiful azure waters surrounding a dramatic chunk of earth in the middle of the ocean.
… Come during the day – the view is sublime, it’d be a shame to waste it at night! Try and schedule your booking just before the tides start rising.” – TripAdvisor traveler Dan G
Where to stay nearby: Pingwe’s Karafuu Beach Resort and Spa is reasonably priced (find the latest deals on TripAdvisor) and offers fun activities like Swahili lessons along with its spacious bungalows. For a romantic stay, try the Travelers’ Choice award-winning Boutique Hotel Matlai, a popular spot for couples and honeymooners."
"37","The classiest, most sophisticated and oldest neighborhood in Boston is the perfect spot for architecture fans, joggers and garden lovers. The Victorian brownstones that dot Back Bay’s cobbled streets are some of New England’s best preserved examples of 19th-century architecture. Fill a lazy weekend wandering around the green spaces of Boston Common, exploring the Boston Public Gardens, and window shopping on Newbury Street. The Charles River Esplanade is popular with joggers and visitors who want to explore the city by canoe or kayak. Refuel with margaritas, tacos and tapas at the popular Lolita Cocina & Tequila Bar before turning in for the night at the stunning Fairmont Copley Plaza. “The hotel is historic, stylish, [and] beautiful,” said a TripAdvisor traveler. “Walk around … the ground floor and admire the ballroom, the beautiful ceilings, [and] the decorations.
Jamaica Plain is the perfect headquarters for beer lovers. The neighborhood is home to the famous Samuel Adams Brewery, a popular stop along the Boston Brewery Tour, and historic pubs like Doyle’s Cafe, which one reviewer described as a “friendly neighborhood Irish tavern”. Another popular Jamaica Plain destination is the Ula Café, a rustic spot serving up delicious and hearty breakfasts and baked goods. One TripAdvisor traveler said the cafe “seemed to be very committed to their neighborhood, and their pride showed in the quality of the food.” Book a room at the Taylor House Bed & Breakfast, where you’ll have a perfect view of Jamaica Pond.
Boston’s Little Italy, the North End is a popular destination for pizza lovers. There are even pizza-themed tours taking visitors to the city’s most popular and historic eateries. Food isn’t the only star of the show here. North End is the oldest neighborhood in the city and is home to historic sites like the Paul Revere House, the U.S.S. Constitution and The Old North Church. The Battery Wharf Hotel is located right in the middle of all the action. “. . . It’s near the heart of Boston’s Italian district so if you’re into Italian food you’re in luck,” said one TripAdvisor traveler.
Home to Fenway Park and The Boston Pops, this neighborhood is a popular destination for sports fans and arts aficionados. Outdoors lovers will enjoy the wilds of The Fens nature reserve, while stargazers will love the view from the Boston University Observatory. When it’s time for dinner, travelers say you have to head to Deuxave. This hip restaurant is a popular hangout for Boston’s top chefs. Try the lobster gnocchi; you won’t be disappointed. The classy Eliot Hotel is a historic home base for exploring Fenway/Kenmore. “The vintage charm of this old hotel takes you back in time,” said one traveler.
Home to more than 30 parks, South End is popular with visitors who want to be near the sights but away from the crowds. Begin your day with a walk down the neighborhood’s brownstone-laden streets and then pop into the Boston Center for the Arts to catch an avant-garde art show. Afterwards, grab a slice of that Boston Cream Pie everybody’s always talking about at Charlie’s Sandwich Shoppe. Get some shut-eye at Loews Boston Hotel, a spot that many guests call “the best hotel in Boston.”
“Nothing beats the Boston waterfront,” wrote one reviewer. Located near the city’s Financial District, this neighborhood is within easy walking distance to some of the city’s top sites, including the historic Faneuil Hall Marketplace, the massive New England Aquarium and the famous Freedom Trail. Of course no visit to Boston is complete without a taste of its famous clam chowder. The appropriately named Boston Chowda serves the famous soup along with lobster rolls and crabcakes. The nearby Harborside Inn is the perfect place to stay during your Waterfront explorations. Built in 1846, this former shipping warehouse has been renovated into a hip boutique lodging that one traveler described as “a gem of a hotel”.
Technically its own city, Cambridge has been a long-time haven for intellectuals, scholars and academics. It’s home to two of the world’s most renowned academic institutions, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a variety of unique cafes and bookstores. Explore the collections at the Harvard Museum of Natural History then head over to Toscanini’s, home to what the New York Times calls “the world’s best ice cream”. Try the salted hazelnut and Belgian chocolate milkshake. Complete your Cambridge experience at the Harvard Square Hotel, a small-but-stylish property located near the Charles River.

"38","Opened in 1928, The Whitehall Hotel is located a short walk from some of Chicago’s top sites. “The location is perfect if you’re planning on exploring Michigan Avenue,” wrote one traveler. A recent multimillion-dollar renovation only adds to this boutique hotel’s charm. Added bonus: dogs are welcome!
Another popular destination for visitors is The Guesthouse Hotel, which offers multi-bedroom apartment suites and a home away from home type of experience. “Can’t say enough good things about the hotel, staff and our experience,” said one traveler, who described the suites as having fully stocked kitchens, full size fridges and ample appliances for cooking home-style meals (or at least reheating delicious leftovers from Chicago’s restaurants!)
Finally, The Langham, Chicago offers great views of the city, the Chicago River, and Lake Michigan. The Langham has been listed as one of the best hotels in the United States, if not the world. “Impeccable service, comfortable luxury, amenities galore!” wrote one traveler who has stayed at five-star hotels around the globe.
No matter which Chicago hotel you choose, you’ll find the lowest prices on TripAdvisor. We shop up to 200 sites to find you the best deal.

Chicago is the city that perfected the hot dog and gave us deep-dish pizza and Italian beef sandwiches. Whether you’re looking for iconic Windy City dishes or avant garde takes on international cuisine, Chicago more than delivers. Our travelers say eating out in Chicago is just as important as seeing the city’s sights.
The Publican serves family style dishes at communal tables, allowing you to enjoy good food and good company. The menu here changes daily and reflects the best seasonal and local ingredients available. “Take advantage of the chef’s tasting menu,” said one traveler, who described a lavish meal of oysters, pork belly, and decadent desserts. “Each dish had its own unique delicious flavor, there wasn’t a bad item sent to our table.”
Another popular destination for foodies is Avec. Applying a Midwestern sensibility to Mediterranean cuisine, Avec uses local ingredients to produce exotic combinations like sea urchin bruschetta, confit chicken paella, and pizza topped with butternut squash and jalapenos. Travelers say the hearty wine selection, with bottles ranging from $20 to $90, only adds to the restaurant’s appeal.
Named after a historic Chicago district dating back to the 1800s, The Gage features an inventive menu, impressive beer list, and convenient location just steps from The Art Institute of Chicago and Millennium Park. The menu boasts unique dishes like venison burgers, rack of elk, and a savory house poutine. “They had me at fried pickles,” wrote one traveler.
Of course no visit to Chicago is complete without a stop at Portillo’s for hot dogs or Al’s #1 Italian Beef for their famous beef sandwiches.
To see a lot in a short time, consider taking a tour of the Windy City sights that interest you most.
Departing from Riverside Gardens, Chicago’s First Lady Cruises takes you past some of the city’s most interesting architectural sites. Even if you’re not a building buff, our travelers say the open-air cruise is a must-do for visitors and residents alike. “This is a nice way to get an overview of the Loop area of Chicago,” said one traveler. “We actually like to take friends that visit us first on this tour because it’s relaxing and they get the general sense of the city before we hit individual points of interest.”
After getting your lay of the land, head up. Way up. The Skydeck Chicago sits on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. From here you can get a 360-degree view of the Windy City. A glass ledge juts from the observatory, allowing you to look down and see the street more than 1,300 feet below. Afraid of heights? Don’t worry. You can still get great views of the city without going on the glass ledge, said one traveler, who called the Skydeck a “must-do when in the city of Chicago!”
Another popular Chicago sight is the Lincoln Park Zoo. This free attraction is a favorite with kids and adults. The 35-acre zoo is home to more than 200 species of animals, including gorillas, monkeys, wolves and seals, as well as several rides for kids. “I would definitely recommend this zoo to family and friends,” said one traveler, “there is so much to see and do.”
To cover the rest of Chicago’s top sites, including Grant Park, Adler Planetarium, and Wrigley Field, take the Chicago Grand Half-Day Tour, which takes you through the best of the city’s famed north and south sides. “WOW”, said one reviewer, “What a great way to see the city.”"
"39","Whether you’re craving new inspiration or just want to cross things off your bucket list, you can’t go wrong with a trip to one of the top landmarks in the world. As you plan your visit to any of these world-famous sights, you’ll need to find the right hotel – one that combines comfort, location and value for money.

#1 Landmark in the World
If Angkor Wat is on your agenda, look for a hotel in Siem Reap, a fascinating Cambodian city worth seeing in its own right. TripAdvisor travelers say the Golden Temple Residence offers the best of both worlds: The hotel is a short drive from Angkor Wat and will even help you arrange a (highly recommended), but it’s also walking distance from local sights like the Siem Reap night markets. After a long, hot day of exploring, cool off in the elegant pool or enjoy a complimentary one-hour massage.

#1 Landmark in Europe
To stay just a stone’s throw from the Mezquita, book a room at the Balcon de Cordoba. The Spanish landmark is so close to this boutique hotel that you can book a room with a view of its spire – or contemplate its beauty from the relaxing roof deck. “The hotel is a little oasis of luxury just off the beating heart of Cordoba. It’s quiet, cool and beautifully appointed, but only a minute from the Mosque – Cathedral. Our room has a great view over the city rooftops to the Cathedral and a nice sitting area,” says TripAdvisor traveler HBOB-58.

#1 Landmark in South America
Machu Picchu’s remote location in the Peruvian Andes means that you won’t find any hotels immediately nearby, but the beautiful and historic city of Cusco is a perfect home base before and after your excursion. (You can get to Machu Picchu by bus, train, or, for a thrilling challenge, via a multi-day hike; browse tour options on TripAdvisor here.) TripAdvisor travelers recommend the Hotel Torre Dorada, another Hall of Fame hotel winner known for providing warm, friendly service at an incredible value.

#1 Landmark in Russia
Why stay near just one historic landmark when you can be close to all of a city’s highlights? At the Pushka Inn Hotel in St. Petersburg, the breathtaking Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is just a few minutes’ walk away – and so are the Hermitage, the Winter Palace, the Moyka River and much more. (Book a private tour like this one to see many of them in a single day.)

Located on the top 11 floors of a 48-story tower, the Loews Regency San Francisco is all about views – and many rooms feature panoramic vistas of the glorious Golden Gate Bridge. “There were even binoculars to get a better view of everything outside your window!” says TripAdvisor traveler gregd486. “It was the best view I’ve had in any hotel. Ever. It was incredible.” When you’re ready to venture out into the city, ask the hotel’s excellent concierge team for recommendations, or book a tour in advance to experience the Golden Gate Bridge up close.

"40","The Turks & Caicos are a classic Caribbean gem: This 40-island archipelago has the jewel-toned, crystal-clear water you dream of, wonderful resorts, and excellent scuba diving and snorkeling. Our travelers love the service at The Palms, a luxury resort on beautiful Grace Beach; TripAdvisor traveler TurksHeadGuy says to ask for a room in buildings 1, 3, or 5, which have ocean views. Island Vibes Tours operates excellent snorkeling and parasailing adventures from Grace Bay.
The D.R. is famous for its many all-inclusive resorts—the perfect place to plant yourself and never worry that your trip is going over budget (at these properties, all meals are included in your room rate, and often drinks and activities as well). The Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real, a 2017 TripAdvisor Travelers’ Choice winner, is a family-friendly but elegant option on Bavaro Beach with activities to please all ages. The Dominican Republic is also a great destination for kiteboarders; Fun Trips Kiteboarding offers two-hour lessons in Cabarete, a great way to get a taste of this adrenaline-spiked sport.
	

Not to be confused with the Dominican Republic, Dominica is known as the Caribbean’s “nature island,” a paradise of tropical rainforest. There aren’t many sandy beaches here, but that also means few large resorts, and many fewer tourists than you’ll find elsewhere. Like many of Dominica’s properties, Rosalie Bay Resort is both eco-friendly and focused on wellness: You can watch endangered sea turtles nest on the resort’s black-sand beach, and enjoy meals sourced from the organic garden at Zamaan, the restaurant.
	

The most famous symbol of St. Lucia are the Pitons—two sharp peaks near the island’s southwestern coast—and one of the best views of them comes from the bar at Dasheene, the restaurant at the adults-only Ladera Resort. This hotel’s unique design means that one wall of each room is open to the elements: There’s no air-conditioning, but you do get cooling breezes and blockbuster floor-to-ceiling vistas.
Climbing to the top of Gros Piton is strenuous but totally doable on this guided day tour.
French flair and ritzy resorts entice Hollywood stars and European jetsetters to this glamorous Caribbean isle, more commonly known as St. Barts. Come in May, when the boutiques hold sales and the winter crowds are gone, but the weather’s just as lovely. The Tom Beach Hotel is the perfect spot for the younger crowd who wants to party (La Plage, the hotel’s restaurant, turns into one of St. Barts’ trendiest clubs at night). Families and honeymooners will both find their bliss at Le Sereno Hotel, where almost all of the rooms have views of Grand Cul de Sac beach.
Fancy a little history with your Caribbean getaway? Curaçao has several museums that detail both its indigenous and Dutch past. And the capital of Willemstad is a delightful combination of Old World and New, with tropical-colored buildings and numerous street-side cafes (our travelers rave about this tuk tuk tour of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed city). The Van der Valk Kontiki Beach Resort is a bargain among Caribbean properties; it’s near a number of restaurants and shops, but tucked away in the jungle with lagoon-style swimming pools.
Jamaica may well be one of the region’s best all-around packages: here you’ll find a vibrant culture, a wide range of hotels and resorts, a jungly interior with gorgeous waterfalls tucked into its nooks and crannies, and of course world-famous cuisine and music (a little jerk chicken and Bob Marley, perhaps?). Legendary music producer Chris Blackwell opened Goldeneye Resort in the home that once belonged to Ian Fleming (he wrote several of his James Bond books here), and it’s long been one of the island’s most popular properties; TripAdvisor traveler My_luxe_travels calls it “luxurious but rustic.” Take a private tour of the gorgeous Blue Hole, a crystalline pool and waterfall with a rope swing for the adventurous.
Want to dip your toes into the Caribbean without ending your trip in a long line at customs and immigration? Head to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where a passport isn’t required (and nonstop flights from the mainland are frequent). For a once-in-a-lifetime splurge, book a room at Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve and another Travelers’ Choice winner; this ultra-luxe property has 24-hour butler service, a gorgeous beach, and a five-acre spa. For a more affordable option, try La Concha Renaissance San Juan Resort, a trendy place in the capital with separate pools for adults and families."

"42","Set in a wildlife refuge more than 700 feet above the Jackson Valley, Spring Creek Ranch in Jackson Hole offers one of the most stunning views — if not the most stunning view — of the Tetons in the area. And you’ll be able to sneak a glimpse of the dramatic peaks from several spots around the property, including the rooms and acclaimed restaurant. After a day racing your sweetie down the slopes, soak in the heated outdoor pool, unwind in the renowned spa, or curl up in the lodge-like rooms.
While Resort at Squaw Creek in Lake Tahoe might not be the most intimate (the sprawling property houses more than 400 rooms, after all), it doesn’t skimp on the gorgeous mountain and valley views. Even better, with resort to-dos like ice skating and dog-sledding, couples will have plenty of date activities to choose from. Those who want to spend a cozy night in can take advantage of the rooms with stone fireplaces and kitchens. And if your idea of romance means spending some quality time outside of the room, hit up one of the five on-site restaurants, the ski lift, hot tub, or year-round heated pool, which is perfect for decompressing after a day on the slopes.
With several fireplaces, soft lighting in the hallways, and an earthy color palette throughout, this Colorado mountain resort really knows how to set the mood. Cuddle up in front of the fire pit that’s situated next to the heated saline pool, by the glass-encased fireplace in the lobby, or in the privacy of your own rooms. Chic and homey, the property dials up the romance even more with a 7,000-square-foot spa that features a relaxation room. Couples who are looking for some slope action will be pleased with the prime ski-in, ski-out location and ski valet service.
This charming 96-room lodge near the slopes in Stowe, Vermont is still owned and run by the actual von Trapp family (yes, as in the one whose story was told in “The Sound of Music”). And while the rooms are comfy and bright, they’re not the major draw here. Guests come for the three restaurants, on-site brewery with tastings, fitness center, and three pools, including an adult-only option. Oh, and one look at the impressive mountain views from the room and common areas and you might just have the urge to belt your own version of “the hills are alive!”
The massive Stowe Mountain Lodge is far from intimate, but that just means there’s more space for you and your loved one to keep the spark alive. Bliss out at the inviting spa or swim laps in the big outdoor pool, which puts the mountains on display. There’s also an acclaimed restaurant, where you can toast to your wonderful relationship. Rooms are cozy — all have balconies and most have working fireplaces to stay snug when the temps dip low.
The luxurious 170-room Stein Eriksen Lodge balances adventure with rest and relaxation. Offering ski-in, ski-out access to Deer Valley Resort, the Park City property also features a relaxing spa, year-round outdoor heated pool with a whirlpool and fireplace, and two restaurants (try the tasty Stein burger). Rooms are spacious with whirlpool tubs and satellite TV; upgrade to a suite for a full kitchen and fireplace, if you wish.
Couldn’t find a babysitter in time? Not to worry. The Peaks See Forever Rentals in Mountain Village, Colorado is the perfect romantic getaway when you have the kids in tow, too. Choose between a standalone cabin or two- to four-bedroom condo units. Cabins include wood-beamed ceilings, stone fireplaces, and leather accents. Once you’ve tucked the little ones in, sneak in some alone time alongside a warm fire.
With a chock-full of amenities like an ice skating rink, heated outdoor pool, five hot tubs, a mineral pool, game room, and fitness center in the spa, this 190-room hotel manages to cater to both families and love birds. Couples will appreciate the fireside dining and cocktails, which are served both indoors and outdoors, while kiddos (and let’s be honest, the adults, too) will go nuts for the s’mores kits. To top it off, lodge-style rooms come with balconies with romantic mountain views and suites feature fireplaces, kitchenettes, or both.

"43","Just an hour up the road from Tampa is one of Florida’s best roadside attractions, Weeki Wachee Springs State Park. On hot summer days, the park’s Buccaneer Bay is a real treat. This freshwater water park features slides, rides and a literal lazy river ride along the Weeki Wachee River. Also included in your admission is access to an underwater theater carved from a freshwater spring. Several times a day performers wearing seashell bras and fish tails put on a rendition of The Little Mermaid. It’s old Florida at its finest.
	

Where to stay: Located just down the street from the springs, the Quality Inn gets high reviews for its generous hot breakfast, speedy check-in and recent renovations. “The hotel is almost within sight of the Weeki Wachee Springs,” said one traveler.
Austin is known for its great music and food scenes, but it’s also home to Barton Springs Pool, a natural swimming pool stretching over a whopping three-acre lot. Fed by three underground pools, the springs have been in business since the 1700s, when local tribes used them for sacred ceremonies. Today you’ll find a lively crowd of locals and travelers seeking an escape from the Texas heat.
	

Where to stay: Just a short ride to Barton Springs, the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin is located within walking distance of the capitol building as well as downtown Austin’s best restaurants, shops and music venues. “The rooms are comfortable and very well done,” said one traveler. “Great location, wonderful accommodations.”
Nicknamed the “City of Natural Lakes,” Santa Rosa is overflowing–literally–with natural swimming holes that offer a refreshing reprieve from the desert air. The most popular pool is Blue Hole, a spring-fed sinkhole that’s a hot spot for SCUBA divers and swimmers. Because the water renews itself every few hours, the Blue Hole is completely clear, perfect for watching the goldfish that call it home.
	

Where to stay: La Quinta Inn & Suites Santa Rosa is our highest rated Santa Rosa hotel due to its friendly staff and delicious breakfast. “La Quinta Santa Rosa was one of the nicer hotels we’ve stayed in,” said one traveler.
Regarded as one of America’s most beautiful natural swimming holes, Slide Rock was turned into a state park in part to protect it from its popularity. One of the park’s main draws is a natural water slide that slinks through the red rocks. Feeling even more adventurous? Climb one of the 10 to 40-foot cliffs for an exhilarating leap into the clear cool water. “You have to make this a stop if you are in Sedona,” said one traveler.
Where to stay: Just two minutes up the road from Slide Rock State Park, the Junipine Resort features spacious “creekhouses” where you can enjoy views of the forest and nearby Oak Creek. Book a room with a private hot tub to warm up after spending a day in the chilly waters of Slide Rock.
Natural pools aren’t just for cooling off. Harrison Hot Springs boasts some of the world’s most mineral-dense waters. They’ve been revered as a healing site for centuries. Water temperatures range from a toasty 120 to 145ºF (40 to 62ºC). Can’t handle the heat? The Harrison Hot Springs Public Pool features spring water cooled to a more tolerable 100ºF (38ºC).
Where to stay: One of the best place to experience Harrison’s hot healing waters is the Harrison Hot Springs Resort & Spa. The resort features private hot-springs-fed pools that are a nice upgrade to the public baths. “A truly 5 star hotel,” said one traveler.

"44","Home to the always-moving Shibuya Pedestrian Scramble, described by some as the “Times Square of Tokyo”, Shibuya is one of Tokyo’s most bustling neighborhoods. Wander along the Harajuku Takeshita-dori, another pedestrian route lined with funky stores and eateries, then take a break from the crowds at the Meiji Jingu Shrine. As one reviewer said, this is a great place to “relax and get a breather before tackling the mad scramble that is Tokyo”. After soaking in all the tranquility, head to Hakushu for a taste of Kobe beef, or feast on modern sushi at the popular Kaikaya. You can also eat like a local during a walking tour of Shibuya’s best off-the-grid restaurants and cafes, tasting local delicacies like takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (savory egg pancakes). Stay in the center of it all at the Hotel Century Southern Tower. Its location makes it “very easy for getting around and exploring Tokyo,” said one TripAdvisor traveler.
For those interested in anime and gadgets, Akihabara is the place to be. This district has tons of so-called “multi-story shops” crammed with everything from soft toys and figurines to DVDs, CDs and collector’s items. Popular stores include Kotobukiya Akihabara and Yodobashi Camera, or you can take an anime-themed walking tour to the district’s most popular sites. Continue your cartoon adventures at Maidreamin Akihabara The Head Store, where the meals look almost too cute to eat. The Akihabara Washington Hotel offers great access to the district’s anime-themed sites and shops.
Head to Asakusa to explore Tokyo’s historic side. This Taitō district is home to multiple temples, shrines and a number of annual festivals. The Sensō-ji Temple, Japan’s oldest, is a popular site. So popular that at times it can feel a bit overwhelming. Go earlier if you want to avoid the crowds, advised one TripAdvisor traveler. You can also take in the temple during a morning sightseeing tour. Experience the ancient art of rakugo storytelling at Asakusa Engei Hall (heads up: you’ll want to have at least a working knowledge of Japanese to get the most out of the show). If you’re craving some authentic ramen, Ramen Yoroiya serves big and flavorful portions, plus some great gyoza. To top off your history lesson, book a room at Ryokan Kamogawa where the rooms feature traditional floor mattresses and tatami mats. “Sleeping on the floor was actually very comfortable,” wrote one reviewer.
With its high-end stores and designer shops, Ginza is a must-see district for shoppers. Wako has been selling luxury watches, clocks and fine jewelry since 1881, and the pearls at Mikimoto’s will bedazzle even the most discriminating shopper. With its stuffed animals, action figures and race track, Hakuhinkan Toy Park will appeal to younger visitors. While writers will love the stationery and pens for sale at G Itoya. Fans of the documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” should trek to the famous chef’s restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro Honten, which travelers say offers a “once in a lifetime experience”. Keep up the decadent vibe at Courtyard Tokyo Ginza Hotel among its fine toiletries and linens and super-polite staff.
Ueno is home to some of Tokyo’s best cultural institutions and most colorful markets. If visiting Japan in spring, don’t miss the cherry blossom displays at Ueno Park, which TripAdvisor travelers say is “a must-visit” any time of year. The park is located near the popular Ueno Zoo and the Natural Museum of Nature and Science. Soak in even more history at the Tokyo National Museum with its impressive collection of art and artifacts. “We could have spent days at the Tokyo National Museum,” wrote one TripAdvisor traveler. Finish up your culture lesson with a kaiseki style meal at Innsyoutei. “The traditional lunch is a delight of discovery,” said one TripAdvisor traveler. Tired after all that exploring? Hotel Coco Grand Ueno Shinobazu is a five-minute walk from Ueno Station and has excellent views of the park.

"45","Located on the southwestern tip of Europe, Portugal is one of the continent’s warmest countries. The capital, Lisbon, is also one of Europe’s sunniest cities, with more than 3,000 hours of sunshine per year. Catch some rays at the Terrace BA, a Lisbon restaurant with a popular rooftop bar offering excellent views of the River Tagus. “I love chilling out here on a warm sunny afternoon,” says one traveler of the outdoor hotspot.
Another way to make the most of all that warm weather and sunshine? Hit the beach! Portugal boasts more than 1,000 miles of coastline and is home to some of the world’s most beautiful beaches, including Ponta da Piedade. “This place really is as beautiful as all the reviews say,” says one traveler. “You have to see it to believe it.” Treat yourself to a relaxing stay at the nearby Cascade Wellness & Lifestyle Resort in Lagos.
Surrounded by water, seafood is the star of the show on Portugal’s menus. You’ll find plenty of fresh fish, grilled octopus and steamed clams, as well as tasty takes on sardines, cod and lobsters. Need a break from fish? Portugal also makes delicious cheeses, olive oils and sausage. And then there’s dessert. Portugal was one of the first countries in Europe to work with sugar, giving the country a head start on designing delicious tarts, pastries and cakes (you need to try a pastel de nata – or a dozen –  from Pasteis de Belem – they’re the OGs). In Lisbon, take a private food tour of some of the city’s best restaurants, gourmet shops and bakeries to learn more about Portuguese cuisine. “The food was out of this world,” says one traveler.
Portugal’s winemaking traditions go back centuries. Port and Madeira wines both originated here; the country also makes a zesty white wine called Vinho Verde that tastes like peaches and lime. Get a behind the scenes look at the country’s winemaking history with a tour of Portugal’s most prolific wine regions. From Lisbon, you can take a full-day private guided tour of the vineyards of Setúbal. Porto also abounds with wine tours, including a popular excursion to the Douro Valley’s best family-run estates.
Portugal is consistently listed as one of the best budget destinations in Europe, offering incredible food, wine and lodging at a price point much lower than you’d expect. Why not treat yourself to the six-course tasting menu at Lisbon’s Lisboete, a steal at only 50 euros, including wine. Or maybe sneak off for a long weekend at the luxurious Pousada Palacio Estoi, a palace turned hotel that is our travelers’ highest rated place to stay in Faro.
Our travelers say a trip to Portugal is not complete without a visit to a Fado house. Fado is a UNESCO-recognized music genre that is believed to have originated in Lisbon during the 19th century. The soulful music, usually sung by a solo performer, draws from African, Brazilian and traditional Portuguese rhythms. Inside Lisbon Tours offers a backstage pass to Fado’s origin and history, and also includes a dinner show – or there’s Fado in Chiado, which offers a great introduction to the Fado experience.
Portugal knows how to party. Most of the major cities have a nightlife district where the party doesn’t stop until the sun comes up. In Lisbon it’s the Barrio Alto, where the dancing and reveling spills out onto the cobblestone streets. In Porto, you’ll find bohemian bars and laid back neighborhood dives in the Ribeira district. To get your lay of the land, consider booking a pub crawl or wine tour. Discover Lisbon offers several nighttime tours, as does Pancho Tours in Porto.
Since the 15th century, Portuguese painters have been creating elaborate tile artwork called azulejos. These works of art adorn everything from buildings to metro stations. Around Lisbon offers a behind the scenes look at how these tile masterpieces are created. Take a tour of Azeitão, a region near Lisbon where you can see some of the country’s most beautiful tiles and learn about their history – then take part in a tile-making workshop where you can try your hand at this ancient Portuguese art."
"46","The best tip for eating your way around a new city? Go where the locals go. At the Tokyo Station Hotel, staff will help you get a table at the city’s most popular restaurants as well as the lesser-known locations the locals love. “The concierge at this hotel, Mori san, is the best thing to happen to a foodie who wants to explore the culinary gems of Tokyo,” said one traveler. If that weren’t enough, Tokyo Station Hotel has what one traveler described as “the most delicious breakfast I’ve ever had in Tokyo”; think French pastries, Japanese porridge and everything in between, including smoked salmon. The hotel is also close to foodie favorites including the vegetarian-friendly T’s TanTan Tokyostation and the French restaurant Monna Lisa.
Many travelers learned about Tokyo’s food scene through the hit movie Jiro Dreams Of Sushi. The documentary follows the journey of Jiro Ono, proprietor of the Michelin three-star restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro Honten. Stay within walking distance of the Tokyo sushi icon at the Millennium Mitsui Garden Hotel Tokyo. Located just five minutes from Jiro’s, the Millennium is also a short walk to the intimate Kyubey Main sushi restaurant and the delightful Tempura Kondo, with its lightly fried scallops and sea urchins. There’s also Il Ponentino, which serves up a delicious pizza if you need a break from Japanese food. Want to eat your way through more of Tokyo? There’s a metro station just around the corner from the hotel.
Another item on every foodie’s Tokyo bucket list is the Tsukiji Fish Market. The world’s biggest and busiest fish market, one traveler called it “foodie heaven”. It’s recommended to get to the market as early as possible for the best selection of fresh fish and sushi. But if you’re not one for a pre-dawn schlep across town, consider staying at the Tokyu Stay Tsukiji. It’s so close, “you need only walk out of the front door and the next thing you will see is fish for sale,” said one traveler. Added bonus: if your clothes smell a little too much of the ocean after your visit to the market, the Tokyu Stay Tsukiji has in-room washer-dryers.
Our traveler community’s favorite restaurant in Tokyo is Ise Sueyoshi, a tiny Kaiseki restaurant praised for its meticulous approach to preparation and presentation. Kaiseki meals, with their multiple courses and special tea ceremony, were originally reserved for royals, but today anyone can get in on the fun. “A must-visit but you need to book well in advance!” said one traveler. If you are unable to make reservations, book a room at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo. It’s a high end hotel located just a quick walk from Ise Sueyoshi. You can easily pop in each morning to see if any tables have opened up for the evening. If they haven’t, don’t despair. The Grand Hyatt is home to 10 restaurants and bars, including Keyakizaka, a Teppanyaki restaurant popular for its abalone and lobster cooked right on the grill in front of you, and The Oak Door, described by one traveler as an “excellent steak restaurant with a high standard of service”.
Dining out in Tokyo can be expensive. And while the food is worth every penny, sometimes it’s nice to get a good meal without having to break the bank. Enter Ichiran, Shibuya, our travelers’ highest rated affordable eats in Tokyo. This ramen restaurant gets high praise for its soups, which start at around $10. “No doubt it was the best ramen I ever had,” said one traveler. You’ll find other delicious options in the area. There’s Genki Sushi, where most menu items are less than $5. Then on the other side of Yoyogi Park there’s Fuunji, a ramen spot where extra noodles are on the house. Located in the middle of all the area’s eateries is Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae. Here you can extend your travel budget even further by taking advantage of the hotel’s free nightly ramen dinners and complimentary shuttle service."
