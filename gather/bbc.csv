"1"	"When mechanics Taye and Kehinde Hamza agreed to service a vehicle at their workshop in Nigeria's Bauchi State in 2010, they could never have imagined the years of hell which would follow.The car, it turned out, belonged to a Boko Haram fighter, and the job was enough to get the twins arrested.It would be another eight years until they were free again, cleared along with 473 others of terrorism charges.Theirs is one tale among many emerging from a mass trial currently under way.Four judges have been hearing cases since last Monday in the town of Kainji, in the central Niger State. So far, those released for lack of evidence far outweigh those convicted of being members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram.Among those cleared of all charges last week were children and the elderly. Some, like the Hamza twins, had been detained since 2010. Mariam Mohammed, a Shua Arab from Borno State, was caught by soldiers as she tried to flee the Sambisa Forest - Boko Haram's base - back in 2014.She had been lured into the forest and married off to a fighter at the age of 11, an official statement from the Nigerian Justice Ministry said.Last week, she turned up in court cradling a three-month-old baby.The long term impact of their imprisonment is not yet known. According to the Justice Ministry, some are suffering from mental illnesses - although whether the conditions existed before their arrests was unclear.At a previous mass trial, held in October, more than 400 suspects were released, with just 45 jailed for their roles in the Boko Haram insurgency which has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced millions of others.  Justice Minister Abubakar Malami told the BBC that the released suspects would be rehabilitated before being allowed to return to their families. But while these judges are making headway into the backlog of people awaiting trial, there are still another 5,000 people are still waiting for their own dates to be set.The judges have found 205 people guilty of terror-related offences - including the mastermind behind the abduction of the Chibok girls.Judges had originally found Haruna Yahaya, 35, guilty of taking part in the 2014 kidnapping - despite his arguments he was an unwilling participant. On Friday, they handed him an additional sentence for planning the mass kidnapping.In total, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. But while convictions like this offer the hope of justice for Boko Haram's many victims, campaign group Amnesty International has questioned the method of the trial.Mass trials of this nature provide insufficient guarantees for fair trial and risk failing to realize justice, Amnesty's Nigeria's director, Osai Ojigho, said. This is particularly so in this case, given that Amnesty International has previously documented how the security forces routinely rounded up and detained hundreds of young men as 'Boko Haram suspects' with no evidence.The Nigerian authorities always insist that the suspects are being given fair hearing at the trials with lawyers provided to defend them through the Nigeria Legal Aid Council, according to the Justice Ministry."
"2"	"At least 17 people have been killed in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, after a huge mound of rubbish collapsed on their homes, officials say. Many more residents were injured when the pile of waste, some 15m (49ft) high, gave way in heavy rains at 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Monday. Rescue workers are continuing to search for people still trapped. The city of Maputo has experienced heavy rainfall since Sunday, which has damaged homes and flooded roads.Several properties were crushed in the incident in the Hulene district of Maputo, one of the poorest parts of the capital, while people were sleeping inside. A spokesman for the emergency services, Leonilde Pelembe, warned that more victims could be trapped under the waste. The information we received from local authorities is that the number of people living in those houses exceeds the number of deaths recorded, Mr Pelembe said.The authorities said they had previously asked residents in the area to leave because their homes were constructed illegally, Reuters news agency reports.However one local resident whose son was injured in the landslide, Maria Huo, said: I live in this neighbourhood because I have nowhere to go. Had the government told me to go to another place to live, I would have left here.In the poorer suburbs of cities such as Maputo, people sometimes live on land they do not own in the hope of finding work. The dwellings can be built on land that is unsafe."
"3"	"Two new language services have been launched by the BBC World Service for Igbo and Yoruba speakers in Nigeria and West and Central Africa.Their digital content is mainly aimed at audiences who use mobile phones. Igbo is primarily spoken in south-east Nigeria and Yoruba in the south-west, as well as in Benin and Togo.The new services are part of the World Service's biggest expansion since the 1940s, following a government-funding boost announced in 2016.In total, 12 services are being launched by the BBC in Africa and Asia.Meet the BBC Igbo team:The BBC's expansion in Nigeria - Africa's most populous country where more than 200 languages are spoken - began last year with BBC Pidgin, which targets those who use the regional English-based lingua franca.It is primarily an oral language, without a standard agreed written form.The BBC Igbo and Yoruba teams have also faced challenges to standardise their written languages for modern audiences - and have sought advice from academics.Yoruba can be very confusing for younger readers because it has so many inflections, so we using a less complex system to appeal to them, says Yoruba service editor Temidayo Olofinsawo.Meet the BBC Yoruba team:There are very few news publications in Igbo and Yoruba in Nigeria, so it is hoped the new BBC services will be popular with Nigerians at home - and in the diaspora.This is the first time the Igbo language will be written and broadcast for international consumption, says Adline Okere, editor of the Igbo service.Igbos are known for their entrepreneurial spirit - and they are spread all over the world, she says.The teams will produce a twice daily bulletin of BBC Minute - an audio round-up of stories as well as news, analysis, explainers and features on the web and social media.The BBC's head of West Africa, Oluwatoyosi Ogunseye, says the focus will be on original journalism.Delivering content and engaging with the Igbo and Yoruba audiences in their mother tongues is authentic, exciting and refreshing, she says.We have had BBC Hausa [mainly spoken in northern Nigeria] for decades and we've seen the impact it had with its audience. When we look at Nigeria we have a multicultural society and the BBC felt that it was very important to give all the cultures a platform to communicate, a platform to interact."
"4"	"Zimbabwe's president has called on all citizens to unite to mourn opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who died of colon cancer last week.A memorial service for Tsvangirai was held in a packed church in the capital Harare, while outside hundreds of supporters of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) gathered.Tsvangirai died in hospital in South Africa on 15 February at the age of 65. He will be buried in his home village of Buhera on Tuesday.  President Emerson Mnangagwa visited Tsvangirai's family to offer condolences ahead of the service.Let us all be brothers and sisters, and come together and mourn our former prime minister, he said after his visit. When we write the history of this country, we cannot leave out the participation and role that the former prime minister played in the effort to entrench democratic values in this country, Mr Mnangagwa added. The new president, who took over following the military ousting of Mr Mugabe in November, called for fair, free and credible elections, which are due to take place this year. Tsvangirai, the fiercest opponent of Zanu-PF rule, had led the opposition MDC since its formation in 1999. He gained the most votes in the first round of the presidential election in 2008, but pulled out of the second round after a sharp increase in violence directed at the opposition. Tsvangirai himself was beaten up and jailed.  As a senior Zanu-PF figure, Mr Mnangagwa has been accused of co-ordinating state intimidation of the opposition at the time, though he has not commented on the allegations. Following an international outcry over allegations of vote-rigging, Tsvangirai shared power as prime minister with Mr Mugabe. In 2013, he ran again against him but lost decisively. "
"5"	"It is rare in a journalistic life that one gets to sit a few yards from a president as he announces his resignation and then, within the same 24 hours, stand in the presence of his successor as he is sworn in. More so when it happens without a shot being fired or vast crowds taking to the streets. But South Africa has always been a nation to surprise. And to infuriate. And to inspire. It is like no other country I have ever reported from. From my first experiences in the apartheid 1980s to the rise of President Cyril Ramaphosa, it has frequently havered between the possibility of disaster and triumph, sometimes accommodating both possibilities within the space of a single day. The fall of Jacob Zuma came about, in part, because of several uniquely South African dynamics. It would never have happened without a strong constitution. This document was forged with painstaking care in the early to mid-1990s and is shaped by the memory of apartheid's brutal excesses and the dictatorships which had caused such misery elsewhere on the African continent. But the protections it enshrines - of free speech, democratic accountability, an independent judiciary - are also reflections of a national characteristic, what I would venture to call a redemptive fractiousness. South Africans love to argue. And they have the gift of being able to laugh at themselves and their leaders. In the dying days of the Zuma government there was a typically South African flurry of dramatic rumours. Zuma might declare a state of emergency and use the army to crush his opponents. Memories of PW Botha and the apartheid emergency of 1986 still haunt an older generation. Then came a story that suggested Mr Ramaphosa was negotiating a deal that might see Mr Zuma given immunity from prosecution if he turned state witness in major corruption allegations. Both were quickly debunked.The South African military will never be allowed to occupy the space in national life that it did in the securocrat apartheid state. Even Mr Zuma's most ardent supporters can remember what happens when you put too much power into the hands of the soldiers. As for immunity, it was always a nonsensical rumour. The new dispensation had no intention of beginning with a shabby deal that would, in any case, have been swiftly struck down by the courts. So how is President Ramaphosa likely to govern? The man I have observed over nearly 30 years is likely to move quickly to reduce the influence of the different security and intelligence departments. This will be a government led by a civilian schooled in the trade unions and civil society who never felt comfortable with the conspiratorial culture of some elements that returned from exile with the ANC.Over coffee the morning after President Ramaphosa's state-of-the-nation speech, my colleague Andrew Harding, who lived through two terms of Mr Zuma, summed up the change: This will be a CEO presidency. Cyril Ramaphosa - South African union leader, mine boss, presidentRamaphosa pledges 'new dawn' for South AfricaPrecisely. Civil servants are already nervously wondering about his plans for downsizing bloated government departments. There will be a war on government waste, and visits to government departments across the country, probably unannounced. But in a moment of hope some caution is needed. Just as in the days after apartheid the public discourse was filled with white politicians claiming they had never really supported apartheid, we can now expect many who thrived under President Zuma to declare themselves to have been ardent enemies of corruption all along. Mr Zuma was undoubtedly the figurehead under whom so much venality flourished. But the rot runs deep in the ruling party. The new president will move carefully, as always, but we can expect to see a steady edging out of those associated with the old regime. Some of them may fall because they find themselves embroiled in criminal proceedings. Others will be cold shouldered and outmanoeuvred. Will this split Africa's oldest liberation movement? I don't believe so. With elections looming next year the party will pull together, recognising that Mr Ramaphosa offers the best hope of victory.Beyond the party, South African society is calling for a reckoning on corruption. There were crooks at many levels of society who stole from state coffers, and many had links to the ANC. The truth commission which followed apartheid saw the beneficiaries of apartheid continue a life of privilege much as they had done before. I sense South Africans do not wish to see a similar veil drawn over corruption. There will be a state capture inquiry to join the other public processes which are forensically laying out the abuses of the Zuma years. And there will be trials of those accused of abusing their power. Jacob Zuma could be among those in court. 'State capture' and other ways Zuma's presidency shaped South African speechThe survivor whose nine lives ran outWhat next for South Africa?Africa is undergoing profound political changes. But one cannot impose a single template and disregard the complex factors at work in different regions. In the last few months I have witnessed the aftermath of elections in Kenya and Liberia, and the removal of unpopular leaders in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In each place the dynamics were different. Zimbabwe happened because the incumbent Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace alienated the security elite that had propped up their ruinous regime for so long. In Liberia, the successful transition from one democratically elected leader to another, for the first time in the nation's history, came about in the context of a broadening of democracy across much of west Africa. In central and east Africa authoritarianism is the dominant force, for now. But the peaceful removal of Jacob Zuma, led by the institutions of a vibrant democracy, will inspire activists in Kinshasa, Kigali, Kampala, Nairobi and numerous other points across the continent. From the days when corruption and misrule threatened to make South Africa a laughing stock there is a chance to reclaim some moral leadership on the continent. "
"6"	"The Monrovia Church massacre in 1990 was the worst single atrocity of the Liberian civil war. About 600 civilians, including many children, were killed while taking refuge in a church. Now, four survivors are bringing a claim for damages against one of the men they believe was responsible, reports Elizabeth Blunt who was a BBC correspondent in Liberia at the time.It was July 1990, and rebel fighters were advancing on the capital, Monrovia. President Samuel Doe was holed up in his vast, gloomy Executive Mansion.  After dark bands of soldiers roamed the streets, looting shops and warehouses and seeking out people from Nimba County, the area where the rebellion had started. They dragged the men from their homes, beating and often killing them. Hundreds of terrified families, looking for a safer place to sleep, took refuge in St Peter's Lutheran Church - a spacious building in a walled compound. Huge Red Cross flags flew at every corner.But on the night of 29 July, government soldiers came over the wall and started killing those inside. An estimated 600 people - men, women, children, even babies - were shot or hacked to death with machetes before the order was given to stop.A Guinean woman doctor, who was one of the first to reach the church the next day, described to me the scene of utter horror. Dead bodies were everywhere. The only sign of life was a baby crying.  She describes having to walk over corpses to reach the child, but when she picked it up and tried to comfort it, she said she suddenly saw a flicker of movement, and then another. A few children had survived, protected by the bodies of their parents, but only when they saw her, a civilian and a woman taking care of the baby, did they dare to come out. One of the child survivors is among those now suing for damages.American missionary Bette McCrandall was there, too, that morning - she had lain awake the previous night, listening to everything that was happening from the Lutheran bishop's compound close by.  She says those events have stayed with her, even all these years afterwards, as they have with all the survivors.  The memories of that day and that night don't leave me, she says.This was the worst atrocity of the war, the event so shocking that it drove neighbouring countries to mount an armed intervention. Yet no-one has ever been prosecuted or held responsible.The man now being taken to court in the US is Moses Thomas, formerly a colonel in the much-feared Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (Satu), based at the Executive Mansion. Survivors have identified him as one of those giving orders that night. Now he lives in the US state of Pennsylvania. Like many Liberians, he was given what is known as temporary protected status, because of the atrocities which were going on back home.Liberia has had a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and Mr Thomas was among those recommended for prosecution - but no cases have ever been brought.So now a movement has started to bring them to justice outside Liberia. Speaking to the BBC after being served court papers on Monday, Mr Thomas called the allegation nonsense.I don't want to give any credence to the allegation, he said. No-one in my unit had anything to do with the attack on the church.Hassan Bility, who heads the Global Justice and Research Project in Monrovia, said he was pleased with the latest development.For 27 years the survivors of this massacre have fought and laboured for justice without success, and nobody has been paying any attention - not the Liberian government, not anybody outside. So this is a small victory, he says.1989: Charles Taylor starts rebellion against President Samuel Doe1990: Doe horrifically killed by rebels1997: Civil war ends after death of some 250,000 people. Taylor elected president2012: Taylor convicted of war crimes in neighbouring Sierra LeoneMs McCrandall certainly sees it as important.  For me, she says, it is a chance for him to own up to what he has done, and on whose orders. That person will have to live and die with the guilt of what he has done. And in my mind it is comforting to me that this issue has not been put to rest, that the case has not been dropped.The snag is that for the moment this is only a civil suit, not a criminal case. A number of criminal prosecutions have started in Europe, where courts will hear cases for war crimes under so-called universal jurisdiction. In the US that is more difficult, so campaigners against impunity have had to be ingenious. One Liberian warlord, known as Jungle Jabbah, was recently prosecuted for immigration fraud, since he had falsely claimed on his application that he had never belonged to any armed group.Mr Thomas is being sued in a civil action by four of the survivors. If they win, he is unlikely to be able to afford much in damages. But campaigners hope that the evidence which comes out in court will make the American authorities question his protected status, opening the way for a criminal prosecution or deportation.But if he is deported back to Liberia, what then? Would he go on trial? Liberia never set up a special court and has never tried any war crimes cases. Many suspects still hold high positions.Campaigner Hassan Bility clings to the hope that now, with a new government now in place, things might be different.  The current President, George Weah, was totally disconnected from the war, he says. He was not part of any faction; he was playing football in Europe... And he gets a lot of his support from poor people, the ones who really suffered in the war... We have the opportunity right now to do this."
"7"	"Street dancers in Sierra Leone have a bad reputation - they're often branded as thieves and troublemakers. Dance troupe Roughest Bounds does much to challenge this image. The group, made up of 12 members, is determined to make it big, despite social and financial struggles.Slim, 17, has been dancing since he was seven. When I started dancing at school I realised I had a talent, he says. People told me I was good and it felt so great to dance and be applauded. I decided I really wanted to pursue this.But the road has not been easy. Slim's father kicked him out of his house, telling him that he couldn't make money dancing in Africa. Now the group stays together in a two-room apartment belonging to their manager, Samuel, who spotted them dancing on the streets last year and decided to support their talent. They share three thin foam mattresses. Samuel's father has urged him to stop helping them and the group has been asked to move out next week. Roughest Bounds practise every day from 2pm until 7pm, both in their neighbourhood and on their rooftop. Crowds of neighbours will often stand around, cheering and applauding.Before they perform in public, the group always prays together. Slim says it's important for their morale. The little money they make comes from dancing in competitions, dance battles and at weddings. This year we've won three battles, says Slim, Each time we were given between 100,000 to 300,000 leones (£9-£27; $13-$39). When we dance at weddings they just give us small tips. The money doesn't last long - we usually use it to buy our costumes for the next performance. In the picture above, the group is dancing for free to a crowd, to publicise a dance battle they will perform in on Saturday.Each member of the group wears a necklace with their name and initials which stand for Roughest Bounds Crew written on it.The boys are very short of money and some days will go without food, or with only one small meal.Slim attends school in the morning. He says: I know I want to be a dancer but I also need to finish my schooling. He was due to sit public exams in January. Every evening, after dance practice, the boys sit together on their balcony and discuss routines for their next performance. In this instance, they're talking about how to choreograph a show at a hotel in Freetown - the theme was Sierra Leonean tradition.Slim shows off some of his stunts. He says that his big dream is to dance in America or Europe to show the people there that we do have talent in Sierra Leone.All photographs © Olivia Acland"
"8"	"Thousands of people attended the first AfroPunk festival to be held on the continent. The celebration of alternative black culture was held in the South African city of Johannesburg recently. The festival describes itself as a blank space to freak out in, to construct a new reality, to live your life as you see fit, while making sense of the world around you.For years the festival has been a space for Africans in the diaspora to explore their heritage. So some described its first appearance in Africa as a homecoming. AfroPunk was first held in New York in 2005, and was started by people who felt marginalised by both mainstream black and pop cultures. They drew heavily on the rebellious spirit of punk.It has since become a global movement, and has been held in Atlanta, Paris and London. The festival celebrates music and culture born of African spirit, as well as alternative music and fashion. It has become synonymous with eclectic, experimental outfits and style.There was some controversy on the first day after South African DJ Cleo pulled out, claiming local artists were not being treated with the same respect as international ones. But that didn't seem to stop music-lovers dancing to both legendary old and popular new South African musicians, including Kwaito star Thebe, below. Kwaito music developed in South Africa in the early 1990s.Traditional healer, artist and activist Albert Ibokwe Khoza, below, accompanied The Brother Moves On for their carnivalesque performance.International artists, including British performer Laura Mvula, below, and American Anderson .Paak kept festival-goers entertained on day two. US star Solange was meant to be the headline act but she cancelled due to sickness. Some say the AfroPunk movement has become a victim of its own popularity, and has become mainstream. Pride in black hair, beauty and fashion were all on display, in keeping with the themes of the festival.The festival also champions inclusion of people of all backgrounds, ethnicities and sexual orientations. Screens flashing the messages rejecting ableism, sexism, homophobia and racism were on display throughout the festival.Art was also created - Gloria Shoki, below, urged others to join her painting a graffiti mural.For 29-year-old performance artist and poet Thola Antamu, below, this was a chance to dress up in her most regal attire.The new generation of African designersMadagascar's love affair with vintage French carKenyan fashionista dares to stand out in Kibera slumThe tattoos Eritreans get before they leave for EuropeThe street child who became a top photographer  Artists take over Ghana's streetsImages copyrighted"
"9"	"What does it feel like to capture the defining moments of Africa's biggest news stories of 2017 on camera? Here, four photographers tell the BBC about their favourite shots from the year.Mike Hutchings is Reuters' chief photographer in southern Africa. Based in Cape Town, he travelled to Zimbabwe in November to document the military takeover which would eventually unseat Robert Mugabe.Earlier in the day, Hutchings had been taking photos outside the parliament while lawmakers were discussing the impeachment of President Mugabe. But the feeling was pretty low key - albeit with a sense of anticipation. After filing those photos, he decided to walk around Unity Square, outside the parliament, one last time. He was looking for a taxi when a colleague phoned him and told him President Mugabe had resigned.  Hutchings ran to the street corner with his camera and heard a huge eruption of cheers and joy from a group of people - that is the moment he captured. I like the energy and the relief of the photo, the photographer explained. It felt really good to be there at that particular time and share that moment.Reuters' chief photographer for north-west Africa, Zohra Bensemra, travelled to a temporary shelter camp in Dallow, Somalia, where she met Zeinab.Like millions of teenagers around the world, Zeinab does her make-up carefully before she goes to school each morning.Unlike millions of teens though, the 14-year-old has already been married - forced into it by her family.Zeinab's family are among almost 900,000 Somalis who have fled their homes, not because of war, but because of a drought and the very real risk of starvation it brought with it.But reaching the aid camp costs money, and Zeinab's dowry would earn the family $1,000 - enough to make the journey.Zeinab refused, however. She ran away and hid in the forest, but eventually she was brought home, locked in a room and forced to marry a man almost four decades older than her.The family, along with Zeinab and her new husband, finally made the journey to the camp in Dallow.It was three days since the couple had married: Zeinab wasted no time. She wanted a divorce - and he wanted his money back.Bensemra first met Zeinab in her shelter in the early morning, when the light would be perfect to capture this teenager's daily routine.She had been saved, in the end, by an Italian aid group, who had agreed to pay the money.Now she was like any other teen - initially reticent to apply her make-up in front of the photographer - getting ready for the school day.Why are you applying make-up to go to school? Bensemra asked.Zeinab replied: I want to remain beautiful.But that is not the image Bensemra treasures of Zeinab. Instead, it is the young girl walking to school, holding her books, walking like star. She had nothing but she still wanted to study - I am happy I met her. Nigerian photographer Akintunde Akinleye went to Maiduguri, in the north-east of the country, to meet the men fighting back against militant group Boko Haram.As a Nigerian currently living in Canada, people often ask Akinleye if the whole of Nigeria is at war.It's just a fraction of the country, he says. Many Nigerians don't even know what's going on there, but it affects everybody in the country. It's a big problem.But Akinleye was desperate to show a different side to the war - a side he captured in this image of 38-year-old Dala Aisami Angwalla, one of 30,000 volunteers with the Civilian Joint Task Force (JTF). Angwalla may have been injured in an ambush, but Akinleye did not want to focus on that. Instead, he asked his subject to gaze into the camera - not as a victim - but as if he was asking the world a question. People think everyone living in the north-west of Nigeria, especially the youth, belong to the insurgency, the photographer explained.But Angwalla said it was important to him to show that this isn't true: He wants to protect his home and his community from Boko Haram. It is not easy. Angwalla says that the Boko Haram members live within the community, alongside the vigilantes.The people who are fighting them know them, they know each of these people who are creating problems, Akinleye says.South African photographer John Wessels travelled to the Kasai region in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August with Oxfam. There's a moment of silence, a moment of quietness and reflection in this photo, Wessels says, pointing to the picture of Anny Mafutani, 30.The young woman, one of thousands to flee her village to escape the fighting, is surrounded by everything she was able to escape with, in a church where displaced people are seeking safety. Her story stayed fresh in Wessels' memory for her determination to survive: Those possessions were already packed, ready, long before the militia actually arrived.It meant when gunshots echoed out across the village, Mafutani and her five children were ready to run for the forest.Her husband was less lucky - he was shot and killed as he tried to escape. She was unable to stop for him.Mafutani and her five children spent months in the forest. There wasn't enough food for them in the package they had prepared so she brought them to this church.And yet, she still wanted to make sure she was camera-perfect. Mafutani left Wessels in awe.She could take five people, survive in the forest, but still wanted to take a scarf and put it on to look as good as possible, he recalls.All four of these photographers were interviewed for a series on BBC World Service Focus on Africa, talking about their photos to illustrate a few of the biggest African news stories of the year.

"11"	"A shocking image of environmental crime has been declared the top entry in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) competition. Taken by South African Brent Stirton, the picture shows the slumped form of a black rhino in Hluhluwe Imfolozi Game Reserve.Poachers killed the animal at night, with a silencer, and then dehorned it. Stirton took the photo as part of an investigation into the illegal trade in rhino products. The photographer visited more than 30 such crime scenes in the course of his probe - experiences he said he found depressing.My first child is going to be born in February; I'm 48. And I think I left it such a long time because I kind of lost faith in a lot of the work we see as photojournalists. You lose faith in humanity to some extent.      Stirton, who collected his award at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, believes this particular piece of butchery was probably carried out by local people, but working to order. The usual practice is to sell the animal's two horns to a middleman. This individual then smuggles the merchandise out of South Africa, most probably through Mozambique, to China or Vietnam. In those Asian countries rhino horn has a street value higher than gold or cocaine. The trade is driven by the misguided belief that horn - the same material as toenails - can cure everything from cancer to kidney stones. Brent Stirton told BBC News: For me to win this, for the jury to acknowledge this kind of picture - it's illustrative that we are living in a different time now, that this is a real issue. The sixth age of extinction is a reality and rhinos are just one of many species that we are losing at a hugely accelerated rate and I am grateful that the jury would choose this image because it gives this issue another platform.  Lewis Blackwell, the chair of judges for WPY, said the rhino image had had a searing impact on his panel: People may be disgusted, they may be horrified - but it draws you in and you want to know more, you want to know the story behind it. And you can't escape it; it confronts you with what's going on in the world.     The rather more peaceful image of a young western lowland gorilla feeding on breadfruit is the subject of the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year winning entry. This was taken by Daniël Nelson from the Netherlands, who entered the picture in the 15-17-years-old category. The gorilla is about nine years old and is called Caco by the trackers who took the young Dutchman to see the ape in Odzala National Park in the Republic of Congo. Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered. Their numbers are being denuded by illegal hunting for bushmeat, disease (notably the Ebola virus), and habitat loss (to mines and oil-palm plantations). Daniël, who is now 18, said he first became aware of WPY when he was six. It inspired me immediately, and since then my passions in life have revolved around wildlife, photography and conservation.This image is called Contemplation, taken by Peter Delaney (Ireland/South Africa). It wins the Animal Portraits category. It shows a resting chimpanzee on the forest floor in Uganda's Kibale National Park. Peter is from County Wicklow but WPY inspired him to move to Africa to pursue his photography career.Crab surprise is the title of this picture from Justin Gilligan (Australia). It claimed the Invertebrates category. It shows an octopus choosing a meal in a field of giant spider crabs in Mercury Passage off the east coast of Tasmania.Tony Wu (US) calls this The giant gathering. It is the Behaviour: Mammals winner. Tony is a specialist in photographing sperm whales. This huge gathering was captured off Sri Lanka's northeast coast. Very rarely have such scenes been witnessed by cameras.This unusual photo is titled The ice monster. Laurent Ballesta (France) captured the scene in waters off East Antarctica, close to the French Dumont d'Urville scientific base. It shows the underside of an iceberg. It's actually a mosaic of many images stitched together. It won the Earth's Environments category.Palm-oil survivors is the work of Bertie Gekoski (UK/USA) - the winner of the Wildlife Photojournalist: Single image award. It is taken in eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo. Three generations of Bornean elephants are seen moving across an oil-palm plantation being cleared for replanting. The palm oil industry has reduced and fragmented the animals' habitat. When the animals stray into plantations they often get shot or poisoned, says Bertie.

She got these herring gulls to play for her camera by throwing some bread for them. Ekaterina is just five-and-a-half years old.WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography. Started in 1964 by what has since become BBC Wildlife Magazine, it has grown in scale and this year accepted 48,000 entries from 92 countries. The current competition is organised by London's Natural History Museum. An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday. Next year's competition starts taking entries from Monday.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
"12"	"In our series of letters from African journalists, Elizabeth Ohene looks into recent reports that officials were refusing to register babies with Ghanaian names and only accepting European ones.In Ghana, we have a thing about names and titles. It starts at birth, when there are many naming ceremonies. The first one happens as soon as a child is born and is based on the day of the week he or she arrives. Thus Kwadwo, Komla, Kwaku, Yaw, Kofi, Kwami and Kwasi are the names for males born on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday respectively. The female equivalents are Adzoa, Abena, Akua, Yaa or Yawa, Afua, Ama and Akosua. A week after the birth, on the eighth day, we hold an outdooring - a formal ceremony where the parents announce the child's given name.The day name is still used and later in life, it often becomes your middle name. My middle name is Akua because I was born on a Wednesday. For Christians, later on there will be a baptismal ceremony. In the old days, priests used to insist that a child should be given a Christian name - one that can be found in the Bible.The biblical names given to children would be English or German, because the Bible was first brought to Ghana by people from those countries. That is why you'll meet lots of Ghanaians called John, James and Johann. You might also like: Some time later, there would be another ceremony when parents go to register the child at the Births and Deaths Registry. Judging from recent events in Ghana, it would seem that things have been coming to a head at this last naming ceremony. The registry began refusing to register certain names that it deemed inappropriate.This included names like Nana, Naa, Nii, Owula, Togbe, Junior and Prince - all of which are popular in Ghana. The registry said these names were titles, not real names, and that they were intended for chiefs and royals - not ordinary children.Nana's closest equivalent in English is Your Royal Highness. That name, from the Akan language, also exists in the Ga language as Nii for boys and Naa for girls.The name Owula can be translated as Esquire, while the Ewe name, Togbe, literally means grandfather - indicating that the child has been named in honour of their elder.The registry also rejected names where the English name came after the local language name. Writs have been filed in the courts, questions have been asked in parliament and a Minister of State has had to appear in the House to answer questions on the subject. He assured politicians and the people of Ghana that the registry would accept names that they had been refusing to register. The minister added that parents were free to register local language names as first names, and English names as the middle names. This does not mean that people are now free to give their children whatever names they want. The registry will not register your child as Honourable, Excellency, or Your Highness in English - but their Ghanaian equivalents, like Nana, are fine.Their change of heart is good news for Ghana's President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.It would have been very strange if the registry had successfully argued that a new generation of Ghanaians could not be called Nana.More Letters from Africa:The teen rescuing street children in NigeriaWhy some Sudanese back the lecturer who beat his studentsInside Africa's WhatsApp's gated communitiesBraving slavery horrors for European dreamLingering cultural colonialism"
"13"	"In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at how a teenager is transforming the lives of a city's street children.James Okina is quite open about his tearaway teenage days: Shoplifting; stealing from classmates; bunking off.I was, he freely admits, mixing with the wrong crowd.It is a shockingly candid confession - especially when you know that Okina, still just a teenager, is marking his third year heading a charity helping the scores of children who live on the streets of Calabar, capital of Cross River State, in southern Nigeria.It is a transformation he credits two people with: Firstly, a cousin, and secondly, a shabbily-clothed 13-year-old he met at a football match the year he finished secondary school.The boy's name was Frederick and he was one of hundreds of children trying to survive on their own in Calabar.Many come from the nearby camps which house people who fled their homes after Nigeria ceded their oil-rich land in Bakassi to neighbouring Cameroon, following a ruling by the International Court of Justice. Others have been labelled witches, and have been abandoned by their families - a common phenomenon in nearby Akwa Ibom state. But Frederick did, in fact, have a family: He shared a room with his mother. However, she had left eight months earlier, and he was fending for himself.He looked tattered but I was surprised by how intelligent he sounded, Okina recalled.Like many street children, Frederick and his friend Kelvin survived by begging during the day. Then, in the evenings, the 13-year-old friends would perform acrobatics to entertain people in bars at night. Okina began visiting them daily, taking along snacks.The bond we shared, it was really about the conversation we had but not about the food and the money, he said. The more we talked, the more I felt a burden that I have to do more.But Okina did not have much. At the time, he was working in a fashion shop to earn some pocket money while waiting for university admission. His dream was to become an entrepreneur, to one day be known as a real estate mogul.  But he knew these boys needed help, so he approached Inyang Edem, a man in his church, who agreed to donate the fees and other requirements for Frederick's and Kelvin's education. After I got these two kids back to school, I couldn't avoid it. I got myself more and more entangled, he said. Okina befriended some street children who hung out at a junction near his house, spending hours a day chatting with them. One day, as he turned to leave, a child grabbed his hand.Okina assumed the boy wanted to ask for money. But, instead, he said: 'Uncle, please come back again', Okina recalled. There and then, Okina made up his mind to do much more for the children. Knowing that having a structure would enable him to attract more support and to be better organised, he formed Street Priests Inc.  In a time when people tend to hold the government or the clergy responsible for change in society, you can help with what you have from where you are. Nobody has to ordain you. That's why we are called Street Priests, he explained.Using Facebook and his other networks, Okina sourced funds for the education of the next batch of 15 children. He continued visiting street children in other parts of Calabar and, in time, he became so popular among them that they would rush excitedly towards any bus or taxi when they spotted him inside, often making other passengers visibly uncomfortable. Three years later, now a business management student at the University of Calabar, 18-year-old Okina has crowdsourced funds for the education of 215 children, and he has a network of about 50 volunteers. I do not intend to go looking for a job, he said.  But I will build my career around this cause.Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:His own comfortable life was turned upside down aged eight when his parents divorced. His determination is unsurprising, given the hardships Street Priests has allowed Okina to see up-close: Like the boy who was almost lynched for petty theft; another who lay comatose by the roadside for more than 24 hours after overdosing on drugs; and three who were simultaneously crushed to death by a falling electric pole. Then there was the boy who escaped from so-called ritual killers, his face still baring the mark of the machete with which they had tried to stop him.People say street children are hardened, but I say they are not - not yet, Okina said. This is how street kids become hardened. They see their friends die. They say:  'The world doesn't care, so why should I?'Okina knows what it is like to think no-one cares.His own comfortable life was turned upside down aged eight when his parents divorced. His mother moved out, but his father insisted on keeping Okina, the middle child, and his two brothers.Unhappy, he began spending more and more time outside their home, mixing with what he describes as wrong friends. His grades crashed and he was constantly in trouble - not least for stealing.I knew that I was not cut out for this life but there was nobody to take me out, he said.Society is very quick to label people as bad or wrong. People are not looking for someone to tell them that what they are doing is wrong. They are looking for someone to take them out.But help for Okina was not far away: A cousin from Lagos inspired the young man.He used to reach out to young people in high schools and barracks in Lagos with reading materials. I found that very inspiring, Okina said. He was also very focused and knowledgeable. By listening to and speaking with his cousin, Okina gradually decided to change the path of his own life. He began taking his studies seriously and soon resumed his former place at the top of his class.Many of the people who volunteer with Street Priests today are my former classmates who knew how bad my behaviour was and how radically I changed, he said. They speak to the children about it and my story inspires hope in them.His mother also volunteers, offering free English lessons to the children. His father died last year. Street Priests has expanded its focus from facilitating access to education for street children to include those at risk of ending up in the street, such as those in displaced persons camps. The organisation's mission now includes advocating for the rights of children, educating the public on child rights, and creating a safe space for children. This last has proved the most challenging, as people are usually reluctant to hire out venues for events involving street children.My plan is for us to get a place that we can call our own, he said. In December 2017, Street Priests held an event to show appreciation to outstanding volunteers and other benefactors. Edem, who gave Okina the money for Frederick's and Kelvin's fees, received a special award, and became so emotional that he shed tears. At the time he gave me the money, he had no idea that he was starting something that would become what it is today, Okina said.More Letters from Africa:Why some Sudanese back the lecturer who beat his studentsInside Africa's WhatsApp's gated communitiesBraving slavery horrors for European dreamLingering cultural colonialism"
"14"	"In our series of letters from African journalists, Yousra Elbagir looks at the reaction of Sudanese to a video of a male lecturer assaulting his students, and what it says about the state of women's rights in the country. The New Year has started off with a bang in Sudan. Civil unrest spread like wildfire across the nation. Protests have raged in cities from Khartoum to Port Sudan, sparked by the removal of subsidies, and other economic measures contained in the 2018 budget.The price of bread and sugar has sky rocketed, the Sudanese pound is in free-fall following its devaluation by the country's central banks and there is a widespread fuel shortage. Security forces have been accused of brute force, with dozens of protestors injured and reports of more than 200 detained. One student in West Darfur, Al-Zubair Ibrahim, was even killed.Despite all of this, one incident has inflamed the popular imagination in Sudan, dominating conversations between family and friends. Videos have circulated of Gasim Bedri - the prominent president of the first all-women university, Al-Ahfad - physically assaulting protesting female students on his campus on 10 January. One particularly shocking video shows the university head walking in front of the demonstrating girls, then suddenly diving into the crowd, grabbing one by her headscarf and repeatedly striking her on the head.The jaw-dropping video spread like wildfire, shared on Whatsapp, Twitter and Facebook and eliciting an astonishing response. While many expressed anger and disapproval of his violent approach, others condoned his actions. Some incorrectly stated that the video was three years old, in an effort to reduce its impact. Some cited Gasim Bedri's illustrious career furthering women's rights and his family's famous legacy of educating and empowering Sudanese women. Others said that he simply had the right to do what he wanted on his campus and that the girls needed to be disciplined. Yousra Elbagir: Some students and parents even argued that the girls were better off being struck by GasimBut even in the midst of these justifications, the most shocking reaction came from his own students - who used terms of fatherly affection and claimed that Baba Gasim was trying to protect them and was hitting them for their own good. Some students and parents even argued that the girls were better off being struck by Gasim than running riot and facing violent police outside of the campus walls.An overwhelming majority of the university's students and staff have stood firmly in support of his actions. His sister and colleague, well-known feminist activist and gender studies scholar Balghis Bedri, came to his defence. She told BBC Arabic that the tape only shows one side of the truth and that some of the demonstrators were threatening to burn down university buildings over rising food prices in the campus cafes. After a slew of newspaper interviews in which Mr Bedri used heavily-debated Koranic verses to justify the physical discipline of women, he released an official apology.His statement read: I take full responsibility for my actions and I hope there is understanding that my intention was, and will continue to be, to protect my students from any dangers they may face beyond the university's walls.Sudan's legislation prohibits the physical discipline of girls in the public education system. Ironically, this is the same system where Babiker Bedri, Gasim's grandfather, relentlessly fought for women to have a space. In 1907, he founded the country's first girl's school and one of the earliest in the region. This legacy - one of incredible progress - is not only undermined by the behaviour shown in the video but also by the cracks in its condemnation, both from individuals and the international institutions that support the private university in the name of female empowerment. This incident and the resulting debate has exposed a contradiction at the heart of Sudan's storied history of feminine resistance. That, despite this long and rich history of Sudanese women standing firmly at the forefront of Sudan's epic uprisings, they are still infantilised in the face of untouchable male authority - whether that entails abuse from a police officer or a so-called father figure and protector.

"15"	"In our series of letters from African journalists, Joseph Warungu peeps into WhatsApp groups to find out who the group administrators really are.I've just been promoted to become the administrator of a WhatsApp group aimed at mobilising support for development projects for my home village in Kenya.With a click and a swipe, I can wipe away any member from the group. So I've been spending sleepless nights, impatiently patrolling the group's activities, waiting for the unfortunate soul who is tempted to contravene the rules governing the group. I had no idea power tasted this goodIs this how it feels to be Minister of Information?That I can breathe hell's fire into any person sharing too many photos and videos of goats dancing with cats?WhatsApp has transformed the way we communicate and socialise. It is also a source of news.  Good news, bad news and lots of fake news.  WhatsApp has also broken relationships and friendships.It's a useful crowd-sourcing tool, which enables you to get any piece of information from anywhere. In one journalists' group that I belong to, it takes seconds to get the contact telephone of almost any Kenyan. In yet another group, plans are at an advanced stage to launch an ambitious business venture conceived and funded by members of the group.There are whole neighbourhoods and gated communities that are on WhatsApp groups. One such group in Nairobi is run very strictly. There is no politics, no religious postings, no jokes. Recently, a Kenyan colleague who needed to travel to India for a medical emergency was able to raise nearly $20,000 (£14,500) in less than two days, through a quick online campaign that relied heavily on WhatsApp.A friend in Ghana told me he's in a group of very influential people, in which one member posted a long letter suggesting he was going to kill himself. The members quickly mobilised a support system for the young man. Joseph Warungu:He got his contacts mixed up and the message, intended for the wife, went to his mother-in-law.But sadly, by the time help reached him, he had taken his life. The group instantly turned into a digital wake in honour of the man.The value of WhatsApp is well known and well documented. Based on my own and other's experiences, I have been examining six different admin models as I decide which one to emulate.These are power-hungry admins. No-one elected them, but everyone fears them. They run the group like a fiefdom. Any attempt to introduce a subject or point of view that does not glorify their ego is tackled viciously. They will not let anyone leave the group. If you try, you're added straight back! I call this house arrest.A West African friend told me how a digital dictator of his group was accidentally relieved of her admin powers when she lost her phone. She pleaded with the interim admin to readmit her on a new telephone line. As soon as she assumed her executive WhatsApp powers, she instantly ejected the acting admin from the group. It took the intervention of a senior military officer who is a silent member of the group to plead for the poor member to be readmittedThese are admins who love the sound of their own voice. They're often found in small WhatsApp groups with only a handful of members. I belong to one such group that was created for a training exercise after which most members left. But the admin can be heard every few moments bellowing down the Whatsapp corridor: Good morning happy people! Just to wish you a happy day!But there's no response. There's no-one here.All you hear is the sound of the admin's voice echoing back and forth with one triviality after another.These are not really admins. But they are the power behind the power.They broker relationships in the group; they determine who belongs and who doesn't. When their interests are threatened, they step in stealthily and take charge with sharp knives in the form of a subtle post here and a sharp hint there that leaves no doubt as to which direction things must go.These are admins who forget they are the leader. They'll be the first to post disturbing images, stir up rebellions amongst sleepy members and be the life of the party. They crossed from street activism to state house but forgot to leave their placards behind.These are the opposite of Digital Dictators. They embrace the world. They have a laissez-faire approach to the office of the WhatsApp administrator. Which means the group is often noisy and chaotic; no-one is in charge and rules are not enforced. As a result, their powers are usurped by scores of aspiring admins.These are misplaced teachers. They relish posts that come with spelling or grammatical mistakes.They will grab such offenders and take them back to pre-school by the ear.Woe unto you if you cannot tame the spelling abilities of your smartphone. They are also the moral detectives of the group and any content that threatens the minds of grown-ups is seized upon with speed.A colleague, who is newly married, once sent a rather explicit message of the plans he had for his wife after his birthday dinner. But he got his contacts mixed up and the message, intended for the wife, went to his mother-in-law.  Such misposting is Christmas dinner for grammar grabbers!Now there are things I will not stomach as the new admin of my WhatsApp group. Because by opting for WhatsApp, my group members have surrendered their power to meet their fellow members in the physical space, or use their human voice to communicate, I too now wield the power to silence their voice. And because the Kenyan authorities hold group administrators responsible for anything that is shared in the groups, I will leave no stone unturned to find out who posted that image of a rat chanting: The powers of WhatsApp groups administrators are unconstitutional!More Letters from Africa:Braving slavery horrors for European dreamLingering cultural colonialismWhy Nigeria is failing teachers and pupilsShould degrees be necessary for leaders?"
"16"	"It has been four years since the Ebola virus outbreak in the West African states of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone was first reported. Photographer Hugh Kinsella Cunningham has been back to document the people still living with the legacy of the disease. The outbreak in 2014 caused more deaths than all the others combined since the virus was discovered in 1976.The virus affected poverty-stricken areas such as Liberia's West Point, where for many, just coping and surviving are everyday victories.West Point is a densely populated township in Monrovia. When the government imposed a curfew and quarantined the area in a bid to halt the deadly outbreak there was unrest and rioting.Eva Nah's grandson was killed by police while he was protesting at the quarantine. All he wanted was to play football and become a mechanic, she says. His father and mother died so I was everything to him.Years on, government compensation for his killing has allowed Eva to send four other children in her family to school.Rita Carol lost her sister to the disease. She used to sell food on the cramped roads of West Point but has saved enough to purchase a refrigerator and start a new business selling ice, which she hopes will provide a good living for her future.Etta Roberts works as a nurse at the Kahweh clinic, a health centre to the east of Monrovia. She usually treats around 10 patients a day for malaria and scabies.The clinic's founder, Reginald Kahweh, funded the building of the centre after losing both his parents to Ebola, saying: Everyone had to step up to create a better society this place was formed to remember those who died.The Ebola crisis was a shock to the Liberian health system, which was quickly overwhelmed. The country's infrastructure was already damaged by a 14-year civil conflict and the health services were struggling to meet basic needs. In response, areas of high risk such as West Point are now monitored carefully for any unusual health trends and a 24/7 duty officer can raise an alert to the National Public Health Institute if a death seems medically suspicious.J Roberts lives by the rapidly encroaching sea in West Point. After losing his wife to Ebola he started a business. My wife was cremated, not buried, so it feels as if she is gone forever. I decided to concentrate on our four children, money is a necessity for them, he says. He sells heated water and the use of booths to wash in. His facility is of great value to the community due to the poor sanitation in the area.Despite positive advances in health infrastructure and the survivors' determination to move on, several former body disposal workers have been left in a state of limbo. Most workers involved with the burial of Ebola victims in Sierra Leone were poor and jumped at the chance of an employment opportunity that few others wanted.Mohammed Kanu was employed by the government to dispose of bodies safely during the outbreak. No subsequent work has materialised and he finds himself still tending the overgrown graves, with little payment.Burial ceremonies that involved contact with the bodies of the dead also contributed to the transmission of the disease and many workers face poverty and stigmatisation for their former roles. Morla Kargbo, another graveyard worker, explains: People don't even want to rent a house to you if you were involved with bodies during the Ebola time.All images copyright Hugh Kinsella Cunningham."
"17"	"One day in August 1995 a man called Foutanga Babani Sissoko walked into the head office of the Dubai Islamic Bank and asked for a loan to buy a car. The manager agreed, and Sissoko invited him home for dinner. It was the prelude, writes the BBC's Brigitte Scheffer, to one of the most audacious confidence tricks of all time.Over dinner, Sissoko made a startling claim. He told the bank manager, Mohammed Ayoub, that he had magic powers. With these powers, he could take a sum of money and double it. He invited his Emirati friend to come again, and to bring some cash.Black magic is condemned by Islam as blasphemous. Even so, there's still a widespread belief in it, and Ayoub was taken in by the colourful and mysterious businessman from a remote village in Mali.When he arrived at Sissoko's house the next time, carrying his money, a man burst out of a room saying a spirit - a djinn - had just attacked him. He warned Ayoub not to anger the djinn, for fear his money would not be doubled. So Ayoub left his cash in the magic room, and waited.He said he saw lights and smoke. He heard the voices of spirits. Then there was silence.The money had indeed doubled. Ayoub was delighted - and the heist could begin.He believed it was Black Magic - that Mr Sissoko could double the money, says Alan Fine, a Miami attorney the bank later asked to investigate the crime.So he would send money to Mr Sissoko - the bank's money - and he expected it to come back in double the amount. Between 1995 and 1998, Ayoub made 183 transfers into Sissoko's accounts around the world. Sissoko was also running up big credit card bills - in the millions according to Fine - which Ayoub would settle on his behalf. In 1998 I was living in Dubai, and I heard rumours that the bank was in trouble. When a newspaper reported that the bank was having cashflow problems, crowds of people gathered outside, waiting to withdraw their money.The Dubai authorities downplayed the crisis. They called it a little difficulty that did not lead to any financial losses either in the bank's investments or depositors' accounts.But this wasn't true.The people who owned the bank took a huge, huge hit. It was not covered by insurance, says Fine. The bank was saved because the government stepped in to help. But they gave up a lot of their equity in the bank for that to happen.And where was Foutanga Babani Sissoko? By this time, he was far away.One of the beauties of his scheme was that he did not need to be in Dubai to keep receiving the money.In November 1995, only weeks after putting on the magic display for Mohammed Ayoub, Sissoko visited another bank in New York, and did much more than open an account.He walked into Citibank one day, no appointment, met a teller and he ended up marrying her, says Alan Fine. And there's reason to believe she made his relationship with Citibank more comfortable, and he ended up opening an account there through which, from memory, I'm just going to say more than $100m was wire transferred into the United States.In fact, according to a case brought by the Dubai Islamic Bank against Citibank, more than $151m was debited by Citibank from DIB's correspondent account without proper authorisation. The case was later dropped.Sissoko paid his new wife more than half a million dollars for her help.I don't know under what legal regime he married her but he called her a wife and she believed she was a wife, says Fine.She understood that there were many other wives. Some from Africa, some from Miami, some from New York.With the bank's money rolling in, Sissoko could fulfil his dream of opening an airline for West Africa. He bought a used Hawker-Siddeley 125 and a pair of old Boeing 727s. This was the birth of Air Dabia, named after his village in Mali.But in July 1996, Sissoko made a serious mistake as he tried to buy two Huey helicopters dating from the Vietnam War, for reasons that remain unclear. His explanation of why he wanted them was emergency air ambulance. But the helicopters he was looking at were pretty big helicopters, they were not the kind that you see running back and forth to hospitals and trauma centres in the United States, they were much bigger than that, says Fine.Because they could be refitted as gunships, the helicopters needed a special export licence. Sissoko's men tried to speed things up by offering a $30,000 bribe to a customs officer. Instead, they got themselves arrested. And Interpol issued a warrant for Sissoko's arrest too. He was caught in Geneva, where he'd gone to open another bank account.Tom Spencer, a Miami lawyer who was asked to represent Sissoko, vividly remembers going to meet him in Geneva's Champ-Dollon prison.I talked with the prison warden, who asked me whether or not Sissoko was going to go to the United States, Spencer says.I said, 'Well, you know, we'll see.' And he said, 'Well, please delay it as long as possible.' And I said, 'Well why?' And he said, 'Because he's flying in fantastic meals from Paris every night, for us.' And that was my first bizarre encounter with Baba Sissoko.Sissoko was quickly extradited to the US, where he started to mobilise influential supporters.The readiness of diplomats to vouch for Sissoko shocked the judge presiding over his bail hearing. And Tom Spencer was stunned when a former US senator, Birch Bayh, announced he was joining Sissoko's defence team.Well, you have to ask yourself, why would anyone get involved for a foreign national who has no apparent value to the United States? says Fine. I don't know the answer to the question. But it's an interesting one to pose.The US government wanted Sissoko held in custody, but he was bailed for $20m (£14.5m) - a Florida record at the time.Then he went on a spending spree.His defence team was rewarded with Mercedes or Jaguar cars. But that was just the start. Sissoko spent half a million dollars in one jewellery store alone, Fine recalls, and hundreds of thousands in others. In one men's clothing store he spent more than $150,000.He would come in and buy two three four cars at the same time, come back another week and buy two three four cars at the same time. It was just, the money was like wind, says car dealer Ronil Dufrene.He calculates that he sold Sissoko between 30 and 35 cars in total.Sissoko became a Miami celebrity. He already had several wives, but that didn't stop him marrying more - and housing them in some of the 23 apartments he rented in the city.'Playboy' is the right word to describe him. Because he is very elegant. And handsome. And he dresses with great style. He blew a lot of money in Miami, says Sissoko's cousin, Makan Mousa.Sissoko was also giving away large sums to good causes. His trial was approaching, and he knew the value of good publicity. In one case witnessed by his cousin, he gave £300,000 ($413,000) to a high-school band that needed money to travel to New York for a Thanksgiving Day parade. Another of his defence lawyers, Prof H T Smith, remembers that on Thursdays he would drive around giving money to homeless people.I was thinking, is this some modern day Robin Hood? Why would you steal money and give it away? It doesn't make any sense, he says.The [Miami] Herald did a story just after he left, and I think - I don't want to exaggerate but I think they said they could chronicle like $14m he gave away. He was only here 10 months. That's over a million dollars a month.Alan Fine took a slightly more cynical view.So much of what he did was for image and to perpetuate a belief that he was a very powerful man and fabulously wealthy. He would give away money, but to my knowledge it was never done in a way that he didn't get publicity for it.Despite this PR drive, when Sissoko's case came to court he disregarded his lawyers' advice and pleaded guilty.Maybe he calculated that this would provoke fewer questions about his finances.The sentence was 43 days in prison and a $250,000 fine - paid, of course, by the Dubai Islamic Bank, though without its knowledge.After serving only half this sentence, he was given early release in return for a $1m payment to a homeless shelter. The rest he was meant to serve under house arrest in Mali.Instead he returned home to a hero's welcome.It was around this time that the Dubai Islamic Bank's auditors began to notice that something was wrong. Ayoub was getting nervous, and Sissoko had stopped answering his calls.Finally he confessed to a colleague, who asked how much was missing. Too ashamed to say, Ayoub wrote it on a scrap of paper - 890 million dirhams, the equivalent of $242m (£175m).He was found guilty of fraud and given three years in jail. It's rumoured he was also forced to undergo an exorcism, to cure him of his belief in black magic.Sissoko has never faced justice. In his absence, a Dubai court sentenced him to three years for fraud and practising magic. Interpol issued an arrest warrant and he remains a wanted man.I found transcripts from other trials at which Sissoko failed to appear, including one in Paris. His lawyer claimed he was a scapegoat for Ayoub's actions and the bank's money had gone elsewhere, but the court didn't swallow it and convicted him of money-laundering.For 12 years, between 2002 and 2014, Sissoko was a member of parliament in Mali, which gave him immunity from prosecution. For the last four years, no longer an MP, he has been protected by the fact that Mali has no extradition treaty with any other country.The Dubai Islamic Bank, nonetheless, is still pursuing him through the courts.I flew to Mali's capital, Bamako, to find people who might tell me about Sissoko.I tracked down his seamstress, who remembered him fondly.The last time I saw him, two or three years ago, I made him a suitcase of clothes. If he didn't give out presents, he wasn't happy. It's his style. He loves to give things to people, she said.I also found his driver, Lukali Ibrahim.The good thing about him is that when things are going well you can expect a lot of presents from him. He likes to help people with their problems, he said. The bad thing, I can tell you a few. This is someone who always gives people hope but instead of telling you the truth, he's just leading you on.In the market I found a goldsmith who had only praise for a client who would call and ask him to make presents for his friends.I also heard that he could be found living near his native village, Dabia, which had given its name to Sissoko's short-lived airline, near Mali's border with Guinea and Senegal.After a long drive I found a house that fitted the description I'd been given.Suddenly, surrounded by armed guards, there he was. Babani Sissoko, in person, now perhaps 70 years old.He agreed to an interview. The atmosphere was edgy and slightly surreal. He began by telling me about his entry into the world.My name is Sissoko Foutanga Dit Babani. You know, the day I was born all the villages round here burned down. The villagers went round shouting, 'Marietto has had a boy.' The fire leapt and leapt. There used to be a lot of bush around.He then talked about his efforts to rebuild the village, which began in 1985, and about the money he made. At one point he had been worth $400m, he said.Eventually, I asked about the $242m he had received from the Dubai Islamic Bank.Madame, this $242m, this is a slightly crazy story. The gentlemen from the bank should explain how they lost all that money. I mean the $242m. Listen, how could that money have left the bank the way it did? That's the problem. It's not this man alone [Ayoub] who authorises the transfers. When the bank transfers money it's not just one person who does it. Several people have to do it. I pointed out to him that Mohammed Ayoub had claimed at his trial that Sissoko had put him under a spell.The gentleman you're talking about, I've seen him and met him, he said. But the heist, he denied.The only contact I had with him was when I went to buy a car. The bank bought it for me and I repaid the loan. It was a Japanese car.Had he controlled people by means of black magic?Madame, if a person had that kind of power, why would he work? If you have that kind of power you can stay where you are and rob all the banks of the world. In the United States, France, Germany, everywhere. Even here in Africa. You could rob all the banks you want.I asked him if he was still rich.His answer was blunt.No I'm not rich any longer. I'm poor.Defying Interpol, Sissoko has spent a remarkable 20 years on the run, even if he has squandered all his money and can never leave Mali.He has never spent a day in jail for the black magic bank heist.Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."
"18"	"Morgan Tsvangirai was the most effective opposition leader in Zimbabwe since independence. His greatest strength was his bravery. He risked his life to stand up to the authoritarian rule of Robert Mugabe and his allies in the security forces. He was twice severely beaten for his pains and three times charged with treason.Despite this, he continually found himself out-manoeuvred by Robert Mugabe who refused to cede any power.Tsvangirai was eventually sworn in as prime minister but found it impossible to achieve any meaningful reforms. However he played a part in paving the way for the overthrow of Mugabe in 2017.Morgan Richard Tsvangirai was born on 10 March 1952 in the Gutu area of Southern Rhodesia, one of nine children of a carpenter.He left school to become a textile weaver, but then went to work in a mine in Bindura, 50 miles north-east of Harare.Tsvangirai became involved in union activities and was elected to the executive of the National Mine Workers Union.When Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 he joined Mugabe's Zanu-PF party and rose to become a senior official. By the late 1980s, he had become head of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which had been set up on independence. As the congress began to break its close ties with Zanu-PF, Tsvangirai found himself at the head of a powerful opposition group.In December 1997 and early 1998, he led a series of strikes, known as stayaways, against tax increases, which brought the country to a standstill.These forced Mugabe's government to cancel two tax rises and to abandon a promised tax to help fund war veterans' pensions. In apparent revenge for his part in defeating Mugabe and the war veterans, a group of men burst into Tsvangirai's office, hit him on the head with a metal bar and attempted to throw him out of his 10th floor office window.In 1999 Tsvangirai founded the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which attracted a younger generation of Zimbabweans, particularly urban workers.They were less interested in Mugabe's historical role as Zimbabwe's founding father and more concerned with his economic mismanagement. Within months, the new party had helped defeat the government over its referendum on constitutional reform, which included clauses allowing the seizure of white-owned farms without compensation. In the 2000 general election, his fledgling movement loosened the ruling party's usual iron grip on power, gaining 57 of the constituency-based seats, against 62 held by Zanu-PF.It was a result without precedent in Zimbabwe, where opposition parties had never held more than a handful of seats. In addition to the government's dramatic defeat over its constitutional reform bill, Tsvangirai won an aura of credibility that was enhanced by the general election result. Tsvangirai himself was not elected. Turning down the opportunity of a seat in one of the cities, where the MDC's support was strongest, he chose instead to stand in his home district - which, like most rural constituencies, was won by Zanu-PF. Now seen as a real threat to Mugabe's presidency, Tsvangirai was arrested shortly after the election and charged with making threats against the president, accusations that were dismissed by a court.In 2001 Tsvangirai made a speech condemning the massacre of anti-Mugabe rebels in Matabeleland in 1984 when an estimated 20,000 people died. In his speech, Tsvangirai promised that those responsible would be brought to justice should the MDC come to power.He was arrested again in 2003 after using a press conference to accuse Mugabe of using violence and intimidation to maintain his hold on government.Officials of the MDC found themselves at loggerheads in 2005 with some members, including Tsvangirai, urging a boycott of any future elections until it could be certain that a vote would be free and fair.The resulting split proved a disaster in the senate elections, with MDC candidates winning only five of the 60 seats.But despite the internal rows, the MDC was still gaining popular support and was perceived by Mugabe as a major threat.In 2007 Tsvangirai was again arrested and, this time, taken to a special forces barracks, where for several hours he was badly beaten, causing a fractured skull and internal bleeding.He was taken to a local hospital where TV pictures of his injuries were taken by a freelance cameraman, Edward Chikomba, and smuggled out of Zimbabwe. Chikomba was later abducted and killed.Just weeks after the beating, police raided the MDC headquarters and again Tsvangirai was arrested.On 29 March 2008, with the MDC still split, presidential and parliamentary elections were held in Zimbabwe. The results of the presidential election were withheld for more than a month amid allegations that the government was attempting to rig the ballot.After a recount, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared that none of the candidates had achieved the required 50% and ordered a second round of voting.Tsvangirai, buoyed by the news that the now reunited factions of the MDC held a majority of the parliamentary seats, initially agreed to take part in the second round.But his campaign was facing increasing levels of intimidation and violence, with MDC rallies being attacked and supporters beaten and killed. Just days before the poll he declared that a free and fair vote was impossible and withdrew from the contest, leaving Mugabe as the only candidate. In July 2008 Tsvangirai met Mugabe for the first time in a decade as a prelude to negotiations over a possible power-sharing arrangement.Against a background of continuing violence, a deal was hammered out whereby Mugabe agreed to surrender day-to-day control of the government.In February 2009, Tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister.Despite the agreement, Mugabe continued to hold the reins of power. The policy of land reform continued with so-called war veterans continuing to invade and occupy farmland.Tsvangirai faced fierce criticism from many sections of the MDC, which claimed his decision to share power had allowed Mugabe to remain in office.He also failed to stand up to Mugabe in what was supposed to be an equal partnership, allowing the wily president to make up the rules as he went along.The result was a loss of confidence in Tsvangirai's leadership, which eventually led to a crushing defeat for the MDC in the July 2013 elections.Just two months later Tsvangirai resigned as prime minister, and Mugabe underlined his dominance by abolishing the post.Morgan Tsvangirai, although a consummate orator, lacked Mugabe's political nous and innate cunning, and even Tsvangirai's supporters said he was often outflanked by the president.But Tsvangirai had the courage to face down the violence and intimidation, and give ordinary Zimbabweans the hope that there was an alternative to the discredited Mugabe regime. In the end he lived to see the overthrow of the president he had battled for so long."
"19"	"The news that Oxfam staff used prostitutes in Haiti has led to renewed focus on how the aid sector works, and what measures are in place to prevent abuse by aid workers. Headlines like Oxfam faces new sex scandal in South Sudan are certainly not flattering, and they come at a time when many countries are debating cutting foreign aid. How does this square with the more standard view of an aid worker: the selfless humanitarian who works in the most difficult conditions in order to improve the lives of the most vulnerable?Of course, there are no perfect saints, and probably no perfect sinners either, in any organisation. But the UN, which regularly uses organisations like Oxfam as implementing partners, is now struggling with a problem many suggest it should have addressed more publically decades ago.This week in Geneva, UN aid agencies took care to express their zero tolerance approach to sexual abuse. Every single report or allegation of sexual exploitation, harassment, or abuse is thoroughly assessed, said Andrej Mahecic of the UN Refugee Agency. If substantiated it leads to sanctions and summary dismissal.We are in the process of introducing mandatory training for all staff, using existing UN courses on the prevention of sexual harassment and exploitation, added Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organisation.But is this enough? Andrew MacLeod, a former UN worker who has been highly critical of the UN system, believes they should have been more active long ago. No one working in aid will be surprised by this, he said.This is not just an issue about Oxfam, it's an issue in all aid agencies all over the world.Since the Oxfam scandal broke, Mr MacLeod has given numerous interviews, and provided an assessment to the tabloid newspaper The Sun which ran the headline UN aid workers raped 60,000 people.Asked by the BBC to substantiate the figures, Mr MacLeod said: I'm not claiming that to be a number of science.So where did he get it? By looking at UN figures for 2016, he explained, which suggest there were 311 cases of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers during that year. A further suggestion by the UN that the numbers would be higher led him to double that annual figure, and then multiply it by ten because generally only about 10% of rape cases are reported. That brought to him an approximate figure of 6000, which he then multiplied by ten again to cover a ten year period.Sensationalist and bombastic, zero creds, was the reaction of one female aid worker with years of experience in the field. Not the experience of any aid agency I have ever worked with. Nevertheless, the UN knows it must now be much more transparent about what it is actually doing to combat cases of abuse.Scandals in the past, such as the sexual exploitation of trafficked women in Bosnia by UN peacekeepers, a sex for food scandal which implicated the World Food Programme in Liberia, and the abuse of children in the Central African Republic by French peacekeepers have all raised questions about the UN's ability to prevent abuse, and to prosecute it when it does occur.In fact, Judith Greenwood, Executive Director of the CHS (Core Humanitarian Standards) Alliance, says aid agencies and the UN do have the tools to tackle sexual abuse in the aid sector, although abuse committed by UN peacekeepers remains (at member states' insistence) the responsibility of the countries the peacekeepers come from.Pointing out that the Oxfam Haiti scandal dates back to 2011, Ms Greenwood said a lot of good policy and practice had been adopted since then. There is an interagency task team that specifically looks at accountability to the affected population. All of our member organisations (all the major aid agencies, including Oxfam) have to have clear procedures in place to tackle exploitation and abuse.Meanwhile Unicef says any allegations of abuse of children in its care are referred to its executive director within 48 hours. They added: We are training our staff continuously in this, and we are improving our assistance to victims.The UN this week also responded sharply to Andrew MacLeod's suggestion that UN aid workers committing abuse could get away with it because they enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Let's be clear about this. The answer is no, tweeted the secretary general's spokesperson. Sexual abuse is a crime. The UN does not and will not claim immunity in such cases.But tweets and restatements of existing policy may not be enough to calm this debate, especially if there are more revelations of historic scandals.UN aid agencies are currently trying to deal with an unprecedented number of humanitarian crises, from Syria, to Yemen, to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Privately senior UN officials are concerned that the headlines may lead to a substantial loss of public support, and a consequent major cut in funding.That's an outcome that won't help anyone, they argue. And here, even UN critic Andrew MacLeod agrees.This is not an excuse to cut aid. This is an excuse to fix aid."
"20"	"When mechanics Taye and Kehinde Hamza agreed to service a vehicle at their workshop in Nigeria's Bauchi State in 2010, they could never have imagined the years of hell which would follow.The car, it turned out, belonged to a Boko Haram fighter, and the job was enough to get the twins arrested.It would be another eight years until they were free again, cleared along with 473 others of terrorism charges.Theirs is one tale among many emerging from a mass trial currently under way.Four judges have been hearing cases since last Monday in the town of Kainji, in the central Niger State. So far, those released for lack of evidence far outweigh those convicted of being members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram.Among those cleared of all charges last week were children and the elderly. Some, like the Hamza twins, had been detained since 2010. Mariam Mohammed, a Shua Arab from Borno State, was caught by soldiers as she tried to flee the Sambisa Forest - Boko Haram's base - back in 2014.She had been lured into the forest and married off to a fighter at the age of 11, an official statement from the Nigerian Justice Ministry said.Last week, she turned up in court cradling a three-month-old baby.The long term impact of their imprisonment is not yet known. According to the Justice Ministry, some are suffering from mental illnesses - although whether the conditions existed before their arrests was unclear.At a previous mass trial, held in October, more than 400 suspects were released, with just 45 jailed for their roles in the Boko Haram insurgency which has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced millions of others.  Justice Minister Abubakar Malami told the BBC that the released suspects would be rehabilitated before being allowed to return to their families. But while these judges are making headway into the backlog of people awaiting trial, there are still another 5,000 people are still waiting for their own dates to be set.The judges have found 205 people guilty of terror-related offences - including the mastermind behind the abduction of the Chibok girls.Judges had originally found Haruna Yahaya, 35, guilty of taking part in the 2014 kidnapping - despite his arguments he was an unwilling participant. On Friday, they handed him an additional sentence for planning the mass kidnapping.In total, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. But while convictions like this offer the hope of justice for Boko Haram's many victims, campaign group Amnesty International has questioned the method of the trial.Mass trials of this nature provide insufficient guarantees for fair trial and risk failing to realize justice, Amnesty's Nigeria's director, Osai Ojigho, said. This is particularly so in this case, given that Amnesty International has previously documented how the security forces routinely rounded up and detained hundreds of young men as 'Boko Haram suspects' with no evidence.The Nigerian authorities always insist that the suspects are being given fair hearing at the trials with lawyers provided to defend them through the Nigeria Legal Aid Council, according to the Justice Ministry."
"21"	"At least 17 people have been killed in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, after a huge mound of rubbish collapsed on their homes, officials say. Many more residents were injured when the pile of waste, some 15m (49ft) high, gave way in heavy rains at 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Monday. Rescue workers are continuing to search for people still trapped. The city of Maputo has experienced heavy rainfall since Sunday, which has damaged homes and flooded roads.Several properties were crushed in the incident in the Hulene district of Maputo, one of the poorest parts of the capital, while people were sleeping inside. A spokesman for the emergency services, Leonilde Pelembe, warned that more victims could be trapped under the waste. The information we received from local authorities is that the number of people living in those houses exceeds the number of deaths recorded, Mr Pelembe said.The authorities said they had previously asked residents in the area to leave because their homes were constructed illegally, Reuters news agency reports.However one local resident whose son was injured in the landslide, Maria Huo, said: I live in this neighbourhood because I have nowhere to go. Had the government told me to go to another place to live, I would have left here.In the poorer suburbs of cities such as Maputo, people sometimes live on land they do not own in the hope of finding work. The dwellings can be built on land that is unsafe."
"22"	"Two new language services have been launched by the BBC World Service for Igbo and Yoruba speakers in Nigeria and West and Central Africa.Their digital content is mainly aimed at audiences who use mobile phones. Igbo is primarily spoken in south-east Nigeria and Yoruba in the south-west, as well as in Benin and Togo.The new services are part of the World Service's biggest expansion since the 1940s, following a government-funding boost announced in 2016.In total, 12 services are being launched by the BBC in Africa and Asia.Meet the BBC Igbo team:The BBC's expansion in Nigeria - Africa's most populous country where more than 200 languages are spoken - began last year with BBC Pidgin, which targets those who use the regional English-based lingua franca.It is primarily an oral language, without a standard agreed written form.The BBC Igbo and Yoruba teams have also faced challenges to standardise their written languages for modern audiences - and have sought advice from academics.Yoruba can be very confusing for younger readers because it has so many inflections, so we using a less complex system to appeal to them, says Yoruba service editor Temidayo Olofinsawo.Meet the BBC Yoruba team:There are very few news publications in Igbo and Yoruba in Nigeria, so it is hoped the new BBC services will be popular with Nigerians at home - and in the diaspora.This is the first time the Igbo language will be written and broadcast for international consumption, says Adline Okere, editor of the Igbo service.Igbos are known for their entrepreneurial spirit - and they are spread all over the world, she says.The teams will produce a twice daily bulletin of BBC Minute - an audio round-up of stories as well as news, analysis, explainers and features on the web and social media.The BBC's head of West Africa, Oluwatoyosi Ogunseye, says the focus will be on original journalism.Delivering content and engaging with the Igbo and Yoruba audiences in their mother tongues is authentic, exciting and refreshing, she says.We have had BBC Hausa [mainly spoken in northern Nigeria] for decades and we've seen the impact it had with its audience. When we look at Nigeria we have a multicultural society and the BBC felt that it was very important to give all the cultures a platform to communicate, a platform to interact."
"23"	"Zimbabwe's president has called on all citizens to unite to mourn opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who died of colon cancer last week.A memorial service for Tsvangirai was held in a packed church in the capital Harare, while outside hundreds of supporters of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) gathered.Tsvangirai died in hospital in South Africa on 15 February at the age of 65. He will be buried in his home village of Buhera on Tuesday.  President Emerson Mnangagwa visited Tsvangirai's family to offer condolences ahead of the service.Let us all be brothers and sisters, and come together and mourn our former prime minister, he said after his visit. When we write the history of this country, we cannot leave out the participation and role that the former prime minister played in the effort to entrench democratic values in this country, Mr Mnangagwa added. The new president, who took over following the military ousting of Mr Mugabe in November, called for fair, free and credible elections, which are due to take place this year. Tsvangirai, the fiercest opponent of Zanu-PF rule, had led the opposition MDC since its formation in 1999. He gained the most votes in the first round of the presidential election in 2008, but pulled out of the second round after a sharp increase in violence directed at the opposition. Tsvangirai himself was beaten up and jailed.  As a senior Zanu-PF figure, Mr Mnangagwa has been accused of co-ordinating state intimidation of the opposition at the time, though he has not commented on the allegations. Following an international outcry over allegations of vote-rigging, Tsvangirai shared power as prime minister with Mr Mugabe. In 2013, he ran again against him but lost decisively. "
